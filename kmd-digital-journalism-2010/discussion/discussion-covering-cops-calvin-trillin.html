	In this discussion we&#39;ll be talking a bit about the article Covering the Cops by Calvin Trillin, published in the New Yorker. (<a href="http://bit.ly/cF17F7" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/cF17F7</a>)</p>
<p>
	We&#39;re interested in your opinions on this article - what it made you think, whether you thought it was well-written, if you agreed or disagreed with the sentiments expressed by the author, and finally, how you can see a genesis from the types of reporting and news that the article is concerned with, and the very different media landscape we see today. I&#39;ve asked a couple of questions, but these really are just to get the conversation going: we want to know what you think.</p>
<p>
	The subject of this article, Edna Buchanan, is a crime reporter for the Miami Herald newspaper. The article goes into a great deal of detail of how Edna works, the way she cultivates contacts, her relationships with the policemen and editors she comes into contact with every day. In many ways, Edna is typical of old-fashioned reporting. But is it possible that there are similarities between her methods of hunting for a story, and the way bloggers and citizen journalists find out stories today? Do you think readers and consumers of media today would be interested in reading the kinds of stories Edna was writing back in 1986?</p>

    <p>I think that with the proliferation of media online, and the decline of major print media it's becoming increasingly difficult for people to cultivate the contacts the way Ms. Buchanan did.  While it's still possible for "legitimate" reporters to cultivate contacts in the same way, I feel that the larger organizations, the police and government especially,  are placing stricter controls on what is released to the public, controlling the spin.   </p>
<p>For me I find making contacts to be fairly easy, but I remain rooted pretty firmly in arts and culture, I have an education in this area to back me up, but the arts is also one of the quickest to adopt the use of these new technologies, so citizen journalists, bloggers, and the web are becoming a standard in promotion.</p>

    <p>The positioning of the reporter is correct and must be kept.Ms. Buchanan has a special attention with the details like the New Journalism school of Wolfe, Capote and others. Regarding the readers,the people like to read on chocking crimes, scandals, things thus. I am enthusiastic of the new technologies and  believe that new medias can enrich the covering of news. A example that is a brazilian magazine of science and technology called "Super Interesting" recently it published a game on as science helps to solve crimes. Seemed with CSI.The content was published in the site of the magazine, as complementary text the substance. Unhappyly it is in Portuguese, is a great example.<br />

About verification of info, contacts and datas. I believe that the curiosity and the capital stock, as charisma and good talk is the differentials to have access to the betters contacts, datas and infos.something fortified with the social medias.</p>

    <p>I think there are a couple of lessons in the story that people can take away. Edna was widely known in Miami as covering a certain beat, and she had a huge network of contacts. </p>
<p>Similarly, I think writers these days can benefit by making it widely known what beat they cover, and by building a similar network of contacts that will help funnel information their way. If you write about the sports scene in Sacramento, make sure that everyone knows it (make it clear on your website, Twitter page, and broadcast it in real life). </p>
<p>Contrary to what someone said earlier, I'd venture to say that cultivating contacts is much becoming easier. In addition to using the telephone as Edna did, we can use channels like email and twitter to reach out to sources. Add to that the fact that the internet/Google trumps the be-jeesis outta the phone book as a people directory, and I'd say that building and managing an 'Edna-like' network of contacts has never been easier.</p>

    <p>I loved the tongue-in-cheek style the article was written in. It's a difficult thing to have humour and not insult the person the article is about, the writer created an image of Edna as a 'Matronly Chic' woman without being in anyway derogatory. I am in love with Edna Buchanan and I respect her idiosyncrasies, the writer nailed it! "That's interesting as heck." </p>
<p>Well...it was a bit long. That was the way things were back then, in this digital age people would want it more concise I guess.</p>

    <p>One of the most striking aspects of the article for me was actually the discussion of Edna's writing style.  Very few of the digital hard news resources I use actually find a balance between neutrality and wit in writing.  The article points out her distrust of editors, but I wonder if the increase in personality-rich content in blogs and other online sources has helped to push the personality and wit out of official hard news journalism sources.  The article actually made me nostalgic for for (largely) unbiased, smart, hard news.  </p>
<p>While blogging and other digital expression channels have dramatically increased the voice of a great many amateur writers, I think the departure of places like the Sun, that hired writers with very little experience, but gave them a lot very quickly, may be missed as institutions to pass on cultures of unbias, ethics, and style. Of course, there have been huge number of unofficial journalism sources that have taken up this mantel, and are still putting out great, ethical, and smart journalism.</p>

    <p>I'm inclined to agree with you David. I think that the up-to-the-minute nature of digital media means that often any ideas of style and tone, which set a journalist apart from the rest, have been lost. And it is a pity. </p>
<p>I also suspect that an older generation's suspicion of new technology may mean that those journalists who are able to produce writing that is balanced and has a personality (becuase they have experience) may move on and be replaced with younger people who have the tech skills but maybe not the writing skills. </p>
<p>That said, I also agree with you that in the digital space, we get to read good writing from many, many more sources, and not just those few who made it into a news room.</p>

    <p>To my impression, only the quantity has shifted towards exchangeable up-to-the-minute news, while the well written stuff is still there. Maybe it depends on the region you look at. At least here in Germany small newspapers are still going quite strong (although a decline is there) and the detailed style of reporting local news is probably one of the very few unique selling points to set them apart from online media. Some seem to make an asset out of it.</p>

    <p>I'll second the remark about quantity shifting towards "fast news". There are still many places where good, long, well-researched and well-written pieces can be found, but those aren't necessarily as visible as they used to be. In France, the "newspapers of record" such as Le Monde, Figaro and Libération, have followed that trend heavily, and one has to turn to publications with lower circulation numbers such as Le Monde Diplomatique or Le Courrier International for Edna-style pieces and recognizable writers with personalities of their own.</p>

    <p><b>David and Rebecca:</b><br /><br />
I think David's comments about the Sun are quite illuminating. Journalists at newspapers not long ago had backgrounds like Edna's. Now, perhaps, her background is more similar to a "citizen journalist" or a blogger. Perhaps that background helped her avoid becoming jaded. Certainly longevity with the cops beat isn't what many journalists with college degrees would have wanted. But Edna did.<br /><br /><br />
<b>Rebecca:</b> You're right about some journalists moving on, and I fear traditional journalism institutions have lost the legendary editors who would teach a young Edna today. I suspect that in most cases in the United States, suspicion of new technology didn't drive them away, but rather a change in journalism pay, plus layoffs and cost cutting of more experienced, higher paid staff.<br />Back in Edna's early days, that turnover likely happened as well, but the U.S. journalism industry has been stable for most of the Baby Boomers' adulthoods, and only now are we seeing a massive diaspora.<br />Perhaps some of those experienced voices will move online and continue to be role models. Here's one, Paige Williams, who wrote a long magazine piece and posted it online for free: <a href="http://www.paige-williams.com/" title="http://www.paige-williams.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.paige-williams.com/</a><br />

    <p>Just some random points - I still need to learn how to write a decent paragraph. </p>
<p>I agree with Gilmar on the importance of social capital. Most bloggers still need to earn social capital. Writing for a newspaper is a head-start. </p>
<p>Does an early lead reinforced by feedback(from search engines and other filters) prevent quality from rising to the top?</p>
<p>Institutions pass on knowledge, experience, craft, mistakes, and biases among other things. </p>
<p>Most of the many, many sources are just "[piggybacking] on traditional journalism’s content" instead of doing the legwork themselves?<br />

<p>The article is very well written (The New Yorker is awesome). As long as the article is I have a feeling it represents a small fraction of notes taken by Trillin. </p>
<p>Here's an article on how "The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains"<br />
<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1" title="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1</a></p>
<p>I read an article somewhere that most of the successful bloggers got in the game early and that more recent entrants struggle to gain a foothold. Unfortunately I can't reference it.</p>

    <p>Regarding the part about Edna Buchanan not joining the TV station:</p>
<p>"One reason, she now says, is that she faced the fact that crime could never be covered on local television with the details and the subtleties possible in a newspaper story.”</p>
<p>This somehow suggests that there is a natural advantage of print journalism over video when it comes to details. But is that really true?</p>

    <p>I do not believe this John. As well as the covery depends on the persistence of the journalist, the way of transmission ( chosen media )depends of the abilities worked by the reporter/jounalist and your team, included sound editors, photographers , filmmakers, illuminators, web designers ,and others.A documentary on tv or a transmedia storytelling in the internet can it can be so good and rich in details like  the newspaper.This depends on the devotion, persistence and creativity of the journalist.

    <p>Regarding the natural advantage of written journalism, it will always be possible to add details from a video (e.g. an incident shot on an iPhone) to a story, whereas with video, once the moment is over, just about the best solution seems to be reconstructions.</p>
<p>Overall I think the article showed that the industry has in some ways changed (Are there still people afforded the time Edna was for research for a decent salary? Do the huge rooms of editors still exist?) but have to admit, I find sources the biggest challenge. </p>

<p>With this in mind, another question that interests me is the short, high-impact sentences discussed in the article. With the huge volume of news and information we get today, I wonder whether these sentences are still a necessity, and even worry how many people read longer and more detailed features to the end (I got to the end of the piece on Edna, but I am not sure I feel I needed to in today's world.)</p>
<p>Take an organization such as Mashable: short snappy articles interpret PR, point out viral vids etc. and are complemented by analyses when the eds feel it necessary later on.

<p>A final point, not so much on crime but on reporting overall, that I wonder about, is whether there are not now organizations away from what would be considered media in the traditional sense.

    <p>It's true that they're the exception rather than the rule, but tech bloggers that do take the time to research and write long, thoughtful pieces are out there, and they too have their share of followers. To me, John Gruber of Daring Fireball (<a href="http://daringfireball.net" title="http://daringfireball.net" rel="nofollow">http://daringfireball.net</a>) would be something like the Edna of tech bloggers. While his blog consists mainly of (very) short pieces, from time to time he does publish an in-depth analysis of an issue, and the article usually becomes very popular, be it on Twitter or on social aggregators (Reddit and such).</p>
<p>I think that the article makes a very interesting point in analyzing Edna's writing style -- a short, bite-sized news item can be easily read even if the writing is amateurish, but a long analytical piece requires a good mastery of writing and an aesthetic sense to keep the reader hooked. (And unfortunately, even that isn't enough). From my own experience as a reader, I do enjoy reading pieces written by people who, in addition to their subject, are also concerned with the craft of writing itself.</p>

    <p>Well. I have read all the previous comments and I will try to reference to principal topics too. </p>
<p>I think that the way of writting of this article is a "profile" (in spanish is a description about an important person) what it provides flexibility in the form; Calvin Trillin has used a similar style what I supose Edna used, at least on the first part. </p>
<p>Calvin describes Edna`s journalism practises, her physique (around a nostalgic ambient) and tricks about her writting, comparing them with Gene Miller´s; so I think that today there is very ways of to show the same information, but between the good journalists only we can talk about different, no better or worse. The story is always the main character, no the journalist; and the good journalist is who just directs the scene into the reader´s mind. </p>
<p>The stories about Edna writes are crimes principally; I think that on this type of stories is very important the description of the situations, the journalist must write like a novel writter, how Agatha Christie, for example... about concrete details, about relationships between protagonists... Story often have a clearly defined, so the journalist can to structure it of a lot of different ways. This involves a great knowledge about all the possible sources. </p>
<p>About the relationships with the cops, I think that today is easier to find new possible sources, but the proximity, confiance, that the journalist has to be with her sources never it will change. Our sources must be our friends, we must know details about them and to be part of their lives. Of course, we now can to do it free too, just time is a requirement.  </p>
<p>Actually, thanks of digital tools, we could accompany this text with an Edna´s photography, a computer graphic showing the structure of the Dade County`s police forces, or a video with the full interview... but is not essential.</p>
<p>Uff. I hope you can understand me... It is very difficult for me thinking in English...</p>

    <p>Hey Guys and girls,</p>
<p>I’ve just finished reading the article. To be honest, it’s been a long time that I did not read an article as long as this one. As a tech engineer and a start up leader, I’m used to reading short and specific articles may be because of the tremendous growth and broadening in technology. Reading a lot of short articles enabled me to stay updated in many fields and have an overview of what’s happening. </p>
<p>At the same time, I enjoyed reading the article because I remembered my old days when I was in primary and early secondary school (just before immersing into Maths, physics and later computing). I was reading a lot and also had a passion for writing (including poetry).</p>
<p>I think that what happened to me happened to a lot of people and the article showed this evidence. I think if Edna is still reporting nowadays, she would not make a lot of phone calls neither ask a lot of questions and may be would accept the TV offer.</p>
<p>I believe the environment affects the individual and so technology affected journalism. Now, it’s for the journalist to know how to best use technology in order to offer good content and thus attracts readership and make them loyal.<br />
To this point, I agree with Gilmar as he said: “A documentary on tv or a transmedia storytelling in the internet can it can be so good and rich in details like the newspaper. This depends on the devotion, persistence and creativity of the journalist. The wealth of a covering is independent of the media.”</p>

    <p>I am just happy that the article is written in common English. I can say that my English is not that bad but my vocabulary is not very broad. And, I believe, that newspaper articles should be written like so - common and very understandable by anyone.</p>
<p>Given the variety of media we have today, articles like the ones Edna writes in the 1980's have a smaller audience today. It's very saddening that people these days would not really have time to read the paper.</p>
<p>I know that the internet can also give a lot of material but there's always a different kind of satisfaction when you write something and it gets printed. Also, when you read something in print.</p>
<p>I don't even believe that many kids today will be willing to do what Edna was doing for her grandmother.</p>
<p>Mr. Trillin has also given a lot of attention to how Edna keeps her contacts. Writers these days have more ways of getting contacts but, during Edna's days of writing, it was easier for her to keep them. Contacts by phone or email can easily disappear and I still don't believe that these lines of communication helps with personal relationships.</p>
<p>I hope I made sense...</p>
<p>*Just a side note, this article is probably the longest I've read in ages!</p>

    <p>I agree with many of the comments already mentioned, particularly the idea that many of our most readily available and consumed news sources are fast and concise microblogs rather than traditional in-depth articles. </p>
<p>However, I think these shorter pieces serve as a springboard for more exhaustive individual research on the part of the reader. Because of the massive amount of information available to us nowadays, it has become harder to distinguish what information we want to or should know. Shorter news pieces make it easier to absorb a larger range of data and then decide what stories we actually want more details for. For example, I may skim through many concise local news articles about Tokyo and find one that mentions the banker-like earning power of the top hostesses in Japan (NYTimes). Because this article may include a particularly fascinating detail about hostess lifestyles, I may find myself suddenly embarking on exhaustive research to find every last detail about hostess culture to satisfy my personal curiosity. Just like Edna was drawn in by seemingly frivolous details that differentiated the crimes she wrote about, I often find myself seeking out the unique details that create vivid stories, regardless of how long it takes to read or find. </p>
<p>While this exhaustive research and vivid individual stories could be written up by a team of professional journalists and crafted into longer, more complex narratives in a traditional news medium, I find that because there are more resources available to regular people, readers are more motivated to dig for every facet of a story through their own channels, discovering new and potentially unrelated topics which could lead to new ideas, new leads. As opposed to letting the journalists decide what we should know more about, we can build our own news experience. </p>
<p>As a sidenote about journalistic writing style, I do believe that many of the writing devices that Edna used have evolved to take on new literary characteristics (though this of course depends on the reader's background). For example, from a American youth's perspective, the Miller Chop is likely to sound more appropriate in the narration for a television crime re-dramatization or a highly-stylized screenplay than an actual serious news piece.</p>

    <p>I think that most everyone here (and I assume we all mostly consume our news online since we've registered for an online journalism course) has hit the nail on the head when they say that this is the longest article they've read in a while. I had to revisit it several times because I was interrupted while reading it. In a normal situation, I wouldn’t have finished reading it at all. </p>
<p>These days, reporters aren’t given much leeway to write long form pieces and readers are no long accustomed to them. Because of cutbacks at news organisations, reporters are expected to churn out three stories a day at dailies and online. That barely gives you enough time to write the story, let alone interview a bunch of sources, visit a crime scene and then carefully craft a great lede. Even in magazines, there is a big focus on service journalism and longer pieces are restricted to 2000 words at the most.</p>
<p>Of course a few publications stuck it out and are still writing great pieces. But dailies feature shorter pieces and magazines like Rolling Stone don’t do much long form anymore.</p>
<p>In any case, the colour in this story was great and highlights how important simple character-revealing details are (in Edna’s research – what was the dog’s name?) and in Trillin’s case (Edna’s cats names, her ceramics, that she’d rather wear a press card on her hat as a throwback to the old style). These details created a vivid picture of a character. Details in reportage like this were most recently brought to the public’s attention in the MIA piece by Lynn Hirschberg in the Times last week. Hirschberg painted a laughable picture of self-professed freedom fighter MIA when she described MIA ordering truffle-flavoured fries (for instance). It’s details that reveal things about people, these are “tells” about personality.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30mia-t.html" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30mia-t.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30mia-t.html</a></p>
<p>In response to Richard, I think Edna’s attention-grabbing ledes would work as well in today’s media climate as they did back then. Her articles were probably short unless they were in the Sunday paper, so she had to convey details as briefly as possible. It’s difficult to write succinctly and meaningfully, it’s something I’m still trying to master. We need to do this now more than ever.</p>
<p>I think research is actually easier these days – I can’t imagine my work in journalism without Google, and I can’t remember the last time I went to a library to find information about a story. Perhaps that says more about me as a journalist, but then again, when you’re writing three stories in a day, there’s not much time for the library.</p>
<p>And to Gueorgui, I think it isn’t just tech bloggers that write great stories – it’s up to the journalist (whether he’s covering crime, tech or dog recitals) to write a great story... though it’s a bit easier to write about something you're passionate about!</p>

    <p>The form of this story probably made me reflect even more than the content did. Our reading habits have certainly changed along with media over the years. This particular New Yorker story might be more palatable as an NPR podcast. </p>
<p>These days stories on the net are shorter. Scannable top ten lists are everywhere. Mainstream headlines are cheaper, it seems. Yahoo looks to have devised a formula: <a href="http://bit.ly/8Z0b83" title="http://bit.ly/8Z0b83" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/8Z0b83</a>.  </p>
<p>Maybe stuff like this is the result of Huffpo-ish A/B testing to see which headlines draw more hits. Do you write for people? Or do you write for search engines? I'd like to think journalists should serve the reader above all else, but reality dictates otherwise sometimes.</p>

    <p>Nicolle,</p>
<p>I agree that quality of writing is still important, but was trying to convey something else in my comment (having read it back I can see I need to brush up on my writing-online-in-a-forum skills. Basically, high-impact sentences need to have high-impact stories underneath them. I don't think high-impact news is as easy to write today though. By the time "exclusives" hit the presses, a bunch of people have normally discussed the story on Twitter, 24-hour news channels have arrived at the scene, Web sites and blogs have started to discuss the e.g. incident and the public already knows what's going on.</p>
<p>And Rick, I agree on the headline point. Charlie Brooker's piece "Online POKER marketing could spell the NAKED end of VIAGRA journalism as we LOHAN know it" hits the nail on the head here. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/charliebrooker.pressandpublishing" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/charliebrooker.pressandpublishing" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/charliebrooker.press...</a></p>

    <p>What I like the most is that the article creates a bigger picture of Miami in those times. All those criminals and drugs and murders... it gives me goosebumps. I find it amazing how Edna came across all those information in the time of pen-and-paper. This has obviously changed in the times of social media, but others have already mentioned that and how. The author did a good job with a right mixture of humor and details on Edna's personality.</p>
<p>The way on how to cover the cops is a good example of how our craving for information has changed in the recent years. If I compare the reporting she did, focusing on all the little personal details, like what movie the victim watched before it was murdered, the difference today is that we want fast facts and especially medical facts in a CSI-manner. We don't care about what the victim's dog's name was but how many times the victim was stabbed and in what places its skull was fractured. We became more indifferent to personal stories and can only be shocked by the cruel facts.</p>
<p>I tried to find Edna's blog if she has one, but I couldn't. It's probably against her old fashioned principles to have one. I'd really like to ask her what she thinks about that.</p>

    <p>I suppose the thing that struck me was how much of what Edna did was wrapped up in entertainment. I admire the methodology, the cultivation of contacts, the pursuit of truth -- but I also can't help but wonder whether the net effect of such reporting on society is beneficial. As stated in the article, the preference is always for covering the sort of murders not covered before -- which I imagine leads one to cover less and less typical murders.</p>
<p>I did a NewsLibrary.com search on the articles Edna published in 1988, and came up with these titles among some others:</p>
<p>KILLING MIGHT BE A MISTAKE COPS: DID HIT MEN GET WRONG TARGET?</p>
<p>RETARDED MAN'S SUICIDE BAFFLES COPS</p>
<p>CABDRIVER, FEARING, HE'S ABOUT TO DIE, KILLS ARMED ROBBER</p>
<p>OFFICER FEARS ARREST, KILLS HIMSELF</p>
<p>ENRAGED MAN, 90, KILLS HIS BRIDE OF SIX DAYS</p>
<p>MAN KILLED ON WAY TO NEW YEAR'S PARTY</p>
<p>The last one notes that the man's homicide was the last of 1988, bringing the 1988 Miami-Dade total to 419.</p>
<p>Edna is only covering a small percentage of those stories, and, as mentioned, she's cherry picking the unusual ones. </p>
<p>I guess this is part of my worry that news tends to deal with the new or unique, whereas public policy has to deal with common-ness of social problems. And yet news shapes public policy. I wonder about the 400 homicides that Edna didn't cover that year -- the ones no one heard about because they weren't interesting enough. </p>
<p>If we heard about the uninteresting deaths as much as the interesting ones, what would public policy look like? My guess is it would be dramatically different.</p>
<p>[I did peek at the writing though during my search -- and yes, wonderful ledes)</p>

    <p>I'll try not to rehash the great points already made above, here are a few notes I jotted down while reading.  Note: I'm a sucker for the New Yorker, specifically Malcolm Gladwell's articles and style of writing (this article was right up my alley).  </p>
<p>It's interesting to read about journalism as a full time job.  A lot of the writers I've known (and definitely most of the bloggers on the planet are all part timers shucking out posts and articles for spending cash or no money at all).  It seems that journalism, especially digital journalism, has become more of a hobbyist endeavor and less of a "when I grow up".  This maybe a false generalization, but how many writers for the New Yorker or New York Times (or the Miami Herald) are writing books as well for supplemental income or to feed their passion?</p>
<p>One point that another article on the suggested reading list made was that most content today is not original.  I find it ironic that even this article in the New Yorker mentioned that "Edna's Story" had been published already in the St. Petersburg Times by Dan Finkel (so, as the article suggested, perhaps digital content is simply continuing that practice, not creating it from scratch).  [source http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2010/03/04/jonathan-stray-on-original-reporting-imaginary-abundance/]</p>
<p>Finally, one of the last points in the NYer article was that Edna sometimes had to do "roundup" type articles where multiple homicides/events were all mixed together into one piece.  As a blogger, my experience is that these posts are actually what people want!  Do a round up of resources, similar news items, websites, videos or anything else, all connected to one topic area then throw a number in the title (a la "14 Killed in the last 5 Days") and tell me if you don't get more hits.</p>

    <p>Edna Buchanan's style of reporting is investigative and well rounded and multifaceted. Modern day blogger's research one specific theme and then usually write a bunch of different articles related to that subject. Today's journalism is so much more collaborative, and with this strong element intercommunication, it therefore arms modern day citizen journalists have the ability to tell the stories we did not get to hear about in the past, raising awareness on a local level than ever before. The advent of the web and social media recently has opened up new channels and opportunities for everyone to have a voice.</p>
<p>Readers of today, would have a hard time reading old style journalism because as a society our cultural attention span has changed. Now we live on a landscape with a sea of cell phones, i phones, i pads, nooks, and so forth. People want their news in a sound bite type of fashion, or 140 characters like we find on twitter. I call this "Main Idea Journalism" - In fact my project is going to be based on this concept.  Would love to hear from all of you.</p>

    <p>After more than twenty four years since the publication of 'Covering the Cops', I have to say it still makes for an interesting read.  Although I have to agree with other members who commented on the length of the story. Since usually, after reading the lead and the following paragraph in any piece of news online, depending on the style of writing I either continue, skim through the rest or search for another source covering the same subject but in a style much closer to my liking. I also expect the lead to at least cover the 5W's and H.</p>
<p>But it's different in this case since the crime story and the descriptive lead by Trillin make the piece more of a feature story than hard core news. I personally find Trillin &amp; Edna's style of writing with all the rich details and descriptions amusing despite my lack of interest in crime stories. I believe readers who have deep academic interest in reading and covering crime stories would still enjoy 'Covering the Cops' or another Edna story. But for a normal consumer of crime stories these days, I would think going through the headlines of a homepage or watching the coverage of such news on TV or on Youtube would sound like a more feasible option.</p>
<p>About the issue of cultivating contacts and this also applies to how Edna could have easily gathered irrelevant details about the victim and the culprit of her stories, "What were they wearing? What did they have in their pockets? What was cooking on the stove? What song was playing on the jukebox?"...etc. Edna could have easily relied on tools like Facebook in her extensive research. Checking the latest status updates or wall posts by the victim or culprit, she might have also been surprised how she actually had a number of friends in common with the culprit and /or the victim making searching for clues, getting in touch with sources and gathering information perhaps a much easier task. The issue of credible news sources still applies but I believe the tools available today (Twitter, Facebook, Blogs...etc) would have helped greatly in the process instead of having to rely mostly on "covering the cops".</p>

    <p>Wow!  It has been forever since I read an article that long.  It was great and I am glad I did.  I felt it was very well written and was able to pull life into it that is relatable.  Edna is real to me.  I feel the article was as much about reporting and writing today as it was Edna and the author did a great job combining the two.  Journalism has changed so much but the fundamentals are still there.  Having something of import and interest to say and saying it.  How we say it and where are what has changed in a way that more people can say what they want.  </p>
<p>I enjoyed being able to connect to Edna and knowing that my biggest hurdle is just doing it.  For her it is a way of life and just does it.  I need to just write.  Just start somewhere and create a bank of my wealth of knowledge and make it known.  There is so much I want to say that getting started is a little daunting.  </p>
<p>Edna, jumped in with both feet and went for it all the way with persistance and dedication.  Thanks Edan for your example and thanks Calvin for sharing it with the world.</p>

<p>Upshot I<br />
Journalism is all about good storytelling – but then murder is quite easy, given the natural excitement of it + all the role models in literature. I guess, a much harder job would be to do the same with topics like local housing problems.</p>
<p>Upshot II:<br />
If you are a reporter, be dedicated, intense and combative about it.</p>
<p>Upshot III:<br />
Find the special things in everyday stories (“If an armed robber kills a convenience-store clerk, the police are interested in catching him; Edna is interested in distinguishing what happened from other killings of other convenience-store clerks. To write about any murder, Edna is likely to need details that wouldn't help an investigator close the case.”)</p>
<p>Upshot IV:<br />
Find the human ingredient within the facts.</p>
