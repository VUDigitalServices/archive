[12:09] <@karen_> Hi there.
[12:11] <indiracornelio> Hi Karen!
[12:11] <indiracornelio> How are you?
[12:12] <@karen_> I'm good. How are you?
[12:14] <indiracornelio> Fine thanks! I have been a little busy so I haven't checked the readings for week 3 :(
[12:14] <@karen_> No problem. :)
[12:14] <@karen_> Did you see the survey I put up?
[12:14] <@karen_> http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GXZ87DF
[12:15] <indiracornelio> but it's exactly what we are about to do, we are checking some other NGO sites to see what are they doing and how?!
[12:15] <indiracornelio> also checking some of the ideas for desing and apps
[12:15] <@karen_> I like SurveyMonkey a lot
[12:15] <indiracornelio> I'll see it now
[12:15] <@karen_> I tried a bunch of open source survey tools but none worked as well
[12:16] <indiracornelio> really? what we use for our workshops is google docs
[12:16] <@karen_> I like Google Docs too
[12:17] <@karen_> But SurveyMonkey has a lot of choices of question formats that are good and it is free too
[12:17] <@karen_> There is a pay version with extra features
[12:17] <indiracornelio> we use the option of forms. Really? I didn't know! Does it also helps with some graphics for the results
[12:18] <@karen_> It gives you graphs of the results
[12:18] <indiracornelio> 'cause thats something I don't like from the Gdocs option
[12:19] <indiracornelio> We have had a big problem with maknig people ansewr the surveys!!!
[12:19] <@karen_> It's hard to get a response on surveys
[12:19] <@karen_> For workshops, I have people do them right there in class
[12:20] <indiracornelio> When we offer a workshop they get full so quickly but after the wrokshop -- from 40 people that attend you only get like 5 to answer
[12:20] <@karen_> Do you do it as a "group activity" in the workshop?
[12:20] <indiracornelio> That's a good way
[12:21] <@karen_> If they don't have computers, I use paper
[12:21] <@karen_> That might also be a good use for Facebook
[12:22] <indiracornelio> We tryied that once also!! but people isn't comfortable with writing and sharing sometimes
[12:22] <@karen_> I tried one of your open-ended questions on FB book this week and got a good response
[12:22] <indiracornelio> we got a lot of Likes, but no response
[12:22] <@karen_> I asked "What's your favorite Web 2.0 tool?"
[12:22] <@karen_> That's funny about getting Likes but no reponse. I have that happen all the time.
[12:22] <@karen_> Even if it's a question!
[12:23] <indiracornelio> Yees!! those really work! I think that's one of the ways to build a community
[12:23] <@karen_> I tried Twuffer this week, but it didn't work that well.
[12:23] <@karen_> I ended up using TweetDeck instead... so far it's good
[12:25] <indiracornelio> Why? hehehe Well it's useful for us as we have a #tipinfoactivista (infoactivist-tip) and we search for rights advocacy news or new tools to use and we share them, so I only program those. But we also tweet from other things.  We are having here a problem. We used FB and TW last year to do so.
[12:25] <indiracornelio> To build a community and it was working
[12:26] <@karen_> I'm doing social media for a big conf in 2 weeks and want to program all the tweets ahead for that
[12:26] <indiracornelio> I think we were doing it good! There were a lot of things to improve but it was good. And now the new director only wants us to do like mmm institutional communiication
[12:27] <@karen_> Wow. Does your new director do FB or Twitter personally?
[12:27] <indiracornelio> noooo, he doesn't like them
[12:27] <@karen_> I have that problem with some school administrators.
[12:28] <indiracornelio> he things they are like useless !!!
[12:28] <@karen_> They don't understand the power of it.
[12:28] <@karen_> Have you shown him examples of the community participation you've had?
[12:28] <@karen_> Or maybe show what other organizations like yours are doing?
[12:28] <indiracornelio> and he doesn't care that it has help us to contact with a lot of people and also we got in touch with a foundation using it!
[12:29] <@karen_> I've gotten actual paying business from social media
[12:29] <indiracornelio> I think that he just don't understand them
[12:29] <@karen_> With some schools I work with, we just do it "under the radar".... without the head person's approval
[12:29] <indiracornelio> yeees!!! cause there is where people is communicating all day!
[12:30] <indiracornelio> And for example in that case. What were the objetives that social media helped you to accomplish??
[12:30] <@karen_> For schools, our main objectives are providing professional development (training) for teachers
[12:30] <@karen_> And engaging students. They really love this stuff.
[12:31] <@karen_> I learn more from my social media connections now than from things like journals or formal classes
[12:32] <@karen_> Marny marketers now are more interested in Twitter and FB than in "traditional" marketing
[12:32] <indiracornelio> yes! it's wonderful what you can do with this tools!
[12:32] <@karen_> True! It's all about connection people
[12:33] <@karen_> connecting....
[12:33] <@karen_> And now a lot of people don't read email or advertising they get in the mail
[12:33] <indiracornelio> Yes!!! And you can see a lot of cool campaings! People that is innovating a loot!
[12:34] <@karen_> True, people who are more innovative and early adopters are on social media
[12:34] <@karen_> Are there other big organizations that your director respects that are using social media?
[12:35] <@karen_> Sometimes people need to hear about it from someone other than their own staff. Sad but true.
[12:35] <indiracornelio> ...
[12:35] <indiracornelio> Thanks! that could help a loot!
[12:36] <indiracornelio> We are about to change our site, and the director wants to do the design and put the information thinking in donator!
[12:36] <@karen_> Do you do grant writing?
[12:36] <@karen_> That's been a big marketing tool for me.
[12:37] <indiracornelio> and well I don't know if it's right!!!! to do something just thinking in one of our like "mkt segments"
[12:37] <@karen_> Maybe you need a site that has different sections -- one for donors, one for others ??
[12:37] <indiracornelio> grant writing?
[12:37] <@karen_> Yes -- market segments?
[12:37] <indiracornelio> ammm I forgot like the name ammm.. like publics
[12:38] <@karen_> Grant writing to get funds from groups like the government or non-profits or World Bank or foundations
[12:38] <indiracornelio> yees, I'm now in charge of that
[12:39] <@karen_> (yes, market segments are different groups you are targeting, like donors, the public, consumers, etc. A lot of people organize different parts of their web site for different groups)
[12:39] <@karen_> Even for connecting with different grant-making organizations, social media is useful
[12:39] <indiracornelio> well that's what we are doing now
[12:40] <@karen_> That makes sense
[12:40] <indiracornelio> Yes! Right now I have like a big crisis in my head!
[12:40] <indiracornelio> Cause we are like changing our strategy
[12:41] <indiracornelio> So I don't know where to start!!
[12:41] <@karen_> That is a challenge when new leaders come in!
[12:41] <@karen_> Do you have a written plan for the business or for marketing?
[12:42] <indiracornelio> yees!!! but mmm. . . I thing I need to add everything there and instead of that I have like 3 docs and in one have like mkt plan, in other the ideas for the site, in other the ideas for social media strategy
[12:43] <indiracornelio> soo i gueess that's what is driving me crazy!
[12:43] <@karen_> :)
[12:43] <@karen_> Good use for Google Docs -- then everyone can work on it together
[12:43] <@karen_> I sometimes have a hard time getting other people to use Google Docs this way
[12:44] <indiracornelio> yes, but i really think I need to get them together cause im like not seeing them as something that has the same objectives
[12:44] <indiracornelio> We all use Gdocs :) it's a great tool we are big fans
[12:45] <@karen_> Starting with the same objectives (mission and vision) will help pull them together
[12:45] <@karen_> Do you know what you are going to do for your final project for the class (week 6-9)?
[12:46] <indiracornelio> I have something to ask to, last year our strategy on FB and TW was: using news about open software, creative commons, etc; also publishing news about our free workshop; also publishing our pictures from activities
[12:47] <indiracornelio> so people participated!! and when we also put some news about environmental things; and information about other free projects or free workshop from other NGOs people respond
[12:47] <indiracornelio> but now new director wants to use TW and FB only for publishing news about US.
[12:47] <indiracornelio> just for that
[12:47] <@karen_> I think that will drive away some people
[12:48] <@karen_> Social media is all about sharing....not just pure marketing of yourself
[12:48] <indiracornelio> sooo . . .  i thing now the objective is a lloott different from building a community
[12:48] <indiracornelio> yeeees!!!! I know!!!!!!
[12:48] <indiracornelio> soooo I'm thinking about how to do that change!
[12:48] <@karen_> Can you do both?
[12:49] <@karen_> Maybe put some questions to your community of FB and Twitter -- "What kind of conent would you like to see here?" or maybe a survey
[12:49] <indiracornelio> both? ammm he doesn't want us to support other NGO activities, only ours; he doesn't want me to keep writing notes from the news because we are not a news agency
[12:50] <@karen_> Hmmm....that's difficult
[12:50] <@karen_> Would he respond to "expert" consulting advice about this? There are some good articles from successful marketing people...
[12:50] <@karen_> But sometimes people are set in their opinions
[12:51] <indiracornelio> so I think that before our objectives were: communication what we are and support (CC, open software, free culture..); also Educating! about some topics!!; communicating our activities...
[12:51] <indiracornelio> and now we'll only do institutional communication
[12:51] <indiracornelio> obviously people will go away!!
[12:52] <indiracornelio> yeees! that could help!!
[12:52] <@karen_> I would also track the number of followers and the number of posts to show when the numbers go down!
[12:52] <@karen_> But it would be better to avoid it all together.
[12:52] <indiracornelio> I really thing the other way was more inteligent
[12:53] <@karen_> I agree.
[12:53] <indiracornelio> yes!
[12:53] <indiracornelio> About my final project, I really need to put everything together at work
[12:53] <indiracornelio> and everything I'm doing at the course
[12:53] <@karen_> I think now that educating people is a big part of marketing
[12:53] <@karen_> You need to market your own social media plan to your new director!
[12:55] <indiracornelio> hahahaha yees!!! exactly. All the info from the course has beeen so helpful! so I think my final project will be that, like replanting the mision, vision statement and loking for the right web presence
[12:55] <@karen_> That sounds good.
[12:55] <indiracornelio> and social media plan
[12:56] <@karen_> If everyone has a common goal, then you can measure the results of different things (like social media) against that goal
[12:56] <@karen_> For my final project, I think I am going to do a marketing video for my open dictionary
[12:56] <@karen_> I have one more question for you.
[12:56] <indiracornelio> that's great!
[12:57] <indiracornelio> sure
[12:57] <@karen_> This morning I was talking to a few people about this course.
[12:57] <@karen_> It seems like the timing is difficult. Some people want to spend more time on different areas.
[12:57] <@karen_> So we were talking about doing a class that would not be organized by week. It would instead be organized by topic.
[12:57] <@karen_> And everyone could spend as much time as they wanted on different topics.
[12:57] <@karen_> Do you think that could work?
[13:00] <indiracornelio> I think that it could be better. In that way you'll find easier to start on something and if you have time to go to the next topic
[13:00] <indiracornelio> and start with that to
[13:01] <@karen_> I think so too.
[13:01] <@karen_> As long as people wouldn't quit before the end :)
[13:02] <@karen_> Thanks for being on the chat today!
[13:02] <indiracornelio> I don't thing so, I think we all have had some hard weeks
[13:03] <@karen_> It's hard to have time for everything!
[13:03] <indiracornelio> Thanks to you Karen!! you really have no idea how helpful this chat are to meee!!
[13:03] <@karen_> I'm glad to hear it!
[13:03] <indiracornelio> See you next chat! Have a nice weekend
[13:03] <@karen_> I think we're mostly going to do them on Tuesdays for the rest of the class.
[13:03] <@karen_> Have a nice weekend there too!
[13:03] <@karen_> Bye.
[13:03] <indiracornelio> Bye!
