[17:10] <pdupuy> Hiya! SOrry I'm late
[17:10] <@karen_> No problem. I wasn't sure if anyone was coming tonight.
[17:10] <@karen_> Glad to see you.
[17:11] <pdupuy> Glad to see you too! IT is weird to me more people don't join these...
[17:11] <@karen_> Me too. Any ideas to get more people participating?
[17:12] <pdupuy> I'll post something about how useful they are to me this evening...
[17:12] <@karen_> Thanks. I've had some interesting conversations w/people this week about the course.
[17:12] <pdupuy> I think if people know we look at each other's sites and work and give/receive feedback...maybe they might be more interested...or maybe intimidated! LOL
[17:12] <@karen_> One person asked if we could start the whole thing over at week 1!
[17:13] <pdupuy> : ) I would be into that!
[17:13] <@karen_> Also a suggestion for daily instead of weekly readings....and for group/team activities.
[17:13] <pdupuy> I got hung up on the marketing plan - still in the works - but am finding it fascinating
[17:13] <@karen_> I've also been talking to a few people about more of an "open" course that is self-paced
[17:14] <@karen_> You could work at whatever speed worked for you.
[17:14] <pdupuy> You know I'm working with another group and they suggest we pair up and have accountability partners and that is helping me.
[17:14] <@karen_> I'm  a little afraid that for some the unstructured pace might make people forget all abouut it and drop out
[17:14] <pdupuy> well, if it is at my speed I can get...distracted...so there does need to be expectations, I think
[17:14] <@karen_> "accountability partners"...that's intersting. Is it in an online course?
[17:15] <@karen_> It's hard to juggle all this
[17:15] <pdupuy> It is an Eben Pagan course - GURU Blueprint
[17:15] <@karen_> But I know that many onlilne couurses see a big drop in participation around week 3-4
[17:15] <pdupuy> They have trouble getting people to do the accountability thing, as well.
[17:15] <@karen_> Do you think assignments done with partners (or in "teams") would work for this course?
[17:16] <pdupuy> THey also do a live phone coaching/teaching thing, so if you can't make it you can download it.
[17:16] <pdupuy> Give me an example of a joint project.
[17:17] <@karen_> I don't know really...it was someone else's idea. I am not sure of it because everyone is focused on their own business or enterprise
[17:17] <@karen_> when we did team projects in business school, one person usually ended up doing most of the work :)
[17:17] <pdupuy> ok - so here is what is working for me, so far:
[17:18] <pdupuy> I am either meeting each week in person or by skype/phone with people and we update each other about our projects, make goals for the week, etc
[17:18] <@karen_> Is it a pretty short call?
[17:18] <pdupuy> Today an accountability partner came over and we compared business plans
[17:19] <@karen_> I'm not sure that wouldl work for me ....but I'm all about different people doing what works for them!
[17:20] <pdupuy> They were just doing a 2 hour call that was coaching - he takes questions , looks at people's work, gives feedback. Hey, do you want to talk/skype - would be easier then me typing all this
[17:20] <@karen_> I'm glad you were finding the mktg plan interesting...I heard a lot of people got hung up with it.
[17:20] <pdupuy> we can keep this open too ,in case someone else joins
[17:21] <@karen_> I like coaching....but don't feel like it's my role in a peer-driven class....would like to see more people wanting to take the lead
[17:21] <@karen_> by the way, did you see or do the "mid-course survey" I put up?
[17:21] <@karen_> communications have been challenging in this course
[17:21] <pdupuy>  i did do the survey
[17:21] <@karen_> Thanks!!
[17:22] <pdupuy> : )
[17:22] <@karen_> Any way, any marketing challenges or successes you'd like to talk about?
[17:22] <pdupuy> what do you think about skyping - could be audio only
[17:22] <@karen_> Skype is fine with me.
[17:22] <pdupuy> i am stillwild
[17:23] <@karen_> I'm on a laptop in my car right now and am not sure I have enough bandwidth...
[17:23] <@karen_> checking....
[17:23] <pdupuy> ok - so...i was interested in the extended marketing - people, process...something else
[17:25] <@karen_> think I just sent you a request on Skype

* conversation moved to Skype

[17:55] <@karen_> I'm back on chat. you there?
[17:55] <pdupuy> back here
[17:55] <pdupuy> yup
[17:55] <@karen_> Do you want to schedule another time to talk on Skype when I'm at my office.
[17:55] <pdupuy> so you are for profit getting grants to provide services for non-profits?
[17:56] <@karen_> We actually write the grants for the non-profits who then contract with us as a for-profit
[17:56] <pdupuy> hmmm. I don't want to impose and time is up...
[17:56] <pdupuy> thanks for the offer!
[17:56] <@karen_> I don't mind if you want to talk another time....
[17:56] <@karen_> I'm around most of the day tomorrow....out Thurs. and in Fri.
[17:57] <@karen_> evenings are usually a good time....
[17:57] <pdupuy> cool - i think I'm good for now but may take you up on this later!
[17:57] <@karen_> Sounds good.
[17:57] <@karen_> Just email me if you ever want to Skype.
[17:57] <@karen_> I usually have Skype off but I'm almost always on email and Twitter
[17:58] <@karen_> Thanks again for being on tonight!
[17:58] <pdupuy> Hey, great talking to you. I have so much interest i all this so it feels good to talk to others with similar interests and especially people that know more than I do!
[17:58] <@karen_> :)
[17:58] <pdupuy> Take care, Karen.
[17:58] <@karen_> You too. And really don't hesitate to drop me a skype request anytime!
[17:58] <@karen_> Talk to you again soon!
