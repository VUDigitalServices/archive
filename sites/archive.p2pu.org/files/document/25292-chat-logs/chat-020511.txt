[12:01] <cris_> Hi Karen!!
[12:01] <@karen> Hi! I thought maybe no one was coming today.
[12:01] <@karen> Glad to see you.
[12:01] <cris_> :-)
[12:02] <cris_> me too!!
[12:02] <@karen> How has the course been for you so far?
[12:02] <cris_> Very  well!! I 'm learning a lot!!
[12:03] <cris_> but dificult...
[12:03] <@karen> That's good. I think all the message notifications have been confusing. Too many.
[12:05] <cris_> For me, too many things are new... it's very interesting!!
[12:05] <@karen> You are in Spain, right?
[12:05] <cris_> yes!!
[12:06] <@karen> Remind me what your business or enterprise for this course is.
[12:06] <cris_> a bank of images
[12:06] <@karen> Oh yes.
[12:06] <@karen> Have you started thinking about the marketing plan for week 2 yet?
[12:06] <cris_> my boyfriens is photographer and he is thinking about it...
[12:07] <@karen> Food images, right?
[12:07] <cris_> a litle...
[12:07] <cris_> but I can't imagine how is the costumer
[12:08] <@karen> Maybe for magazines or bloggers or other people who need food pictures?
[12:08] <cris_> yes
[12:08] <cris_> they might be publishing agencies...
[12:08] <@karen> These are my food pictures on Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/karenandbrademerson/sets/72157609896732068/with/5364308728/
[12:08] <@karen> I'm a vegetarian.
[12:09] <cris_> really?
[12:09] <@karen> Since I was 12
[12:09] <cris_> that's interesting!! we could do some vegetarian dishes also...
[12:09] <@karen> Maybe you could focus on local dishes and tie in travel? (I love tapas.)
[12:10] <cris_> yes!!
[12:10] <@karen> Maybe involve some local restaurants or travel agencies?
[12:10] <cris_> we are thinking about Mediterranian cuisine
[12:10] <cris_> start
[12:10] <@karen> Excellent
[12:10] <cris_> www.domenecgibert.com
[12:10] <cris_> here is his web
[12:11] <@karen> I do some work with a small local farm and we are always looking for ways to show people how to use the vegetables we grow
[12:11] <cris_> but we must put more actual pictures here, he says that are too old theese ones
[12:11] <cris_> it sounds interesting! he used to work for magazines
[12:12] <@karen> Just went to the web site. Beautiful!
[12:12] <@karen> Makes me hungry :)
[12:12] <cris_> but the work in Spain has decreased, so we have to loo for other ways....
[12:12] <@karen> Are you on any photo sharing sites like Flickr?
[12:12] <cris_> I think that he is good with photography, but he must order his ideas...
[12:12] <cris_> no...
[12:13] <cris_> no flicker...
[12:13] <@karen> Might be a good way to connect with other people
[12:13] <cris_> I know!!
[12:13] <@karen> Are there local businesses that you might do partnerships with?
[12:13] <cris_> no...
[12:14] <@karen> Maybe do photography for their menus or web sites?
[12:14] <cris_> we must  associate with the cooker
[12:14] <@karen> There are a lot of free photos available, which makes selling them difficult
[12:14] <cris_> the woman who cook the dishes
[12:14] <@karen> Do you cook?
[12:14] <cris_> no
[12:14] <cris_> he use to work with specialist
[12:15] <cris_> on cooking and photography...
[12:15] <@karen> How about video? There is very little free video available so that might be something people would pay more for
[12:15] <cris_> yes... that's also an option
[12:15] <@karen> How about a cooking show on YouTube? That would be fun.
[12:16] <cris_> :-) Yes!! it sounds good!!
[12:16] <@karen> Are there any businesses near you that have restaurants or do cooking demonstrations?
[12:16] <@karen> I love to go to cooking demonstrations, and it would be great if there were photos and recipes available afterward
[12:16] <cris_> maybe some restaurants
[12:16] <cris_> but what is best paid is publicity...
[12:17] <@karen> Do you do any web site development, or could you team up with someone who does web sites? They are always looking for good photos.
[12:17] <cris_> one of the best things that habve this kind of business, in my opinion is that you receive royalties (do you say royalties?)
[12:17] <@karen> Yes, royalties
[12:18] <cris_> every time that your photos are published
[12:18] <@karen> Flickr has an arrangement with some stock photo houses that do that kind of work
[12:18] <cris_> so, it's a good part of the business
[12:18] <cris_> you work hard one time
[12:19] <@karen> Yes, then you just have to guess what photos people would want
[12:19] <cris_> yes
[12:19] <cris_> and to find good agencies....
[12:20] <@karen> One thing I did not see on Domenec's web site is how to buy his photos....or how to contact him.
[12:20] <@karen> Oh....I see the contact now. But it shoud be easier to find maybe
[12:20] <cris_> no, you can't buy it yet
[12:21] <cris_> it's what we are trying to do
[12:21] <@karen> Oh, I see
[12:21] <cris_> he wants to renew the web
[12:21] <@karen> Yes, that's our Week 3 focus I think :)
[12:21] <cris_> and make new photos only for the new business, for the bank...
[12:22] <@karen> Have you thought about pricing? That's a part of the marketing plan.
[12:22] <cris_> not yet... but it depends on the size of the picture, also it depends on the purpose of it
[12:23] <cris_> it depends if it's for an article, for an advertise
[12:23] <@karen> That makes sense. You might be able to sell lower resolution pictures to people like web developers, but they'd have to be pretty cheap I think.
[12:23] <@karen> For print -- more expensive
[12:23] <cris_> or for an advertising on the street.
[12:23] <cris_> yes, that's it
[12:24] <cris_> and I try to offer competitive prices
[12:24] <@karen> Do you know what others are charging (price)? That's another part of the marketing plan.
[12:25] <cris_> I dont know now here but he knows the prices in Spain
[12:25] <@karen> For the marketing plan for week 2, you don't have to write the whole thing now. Just start with an outline or what questions you know you need to answer.
[12:25] <cris_> ok
[12:26] <@karen> I know a marketing plan is a BIG task.
[12:26] <cris_> but it's important to start knowing where to find this information
[12:26] <@karen> Yes. The web makes this so much easier.
[12:26] <cris_> and to know that it's important to have it!!
[12:26] <@karen> I find a lot of competitive information even in social media like on Twitter
[12:26] <cris_> yes
[12:27] <cris_> it could be also useful to find what are our competitors doing
[12:27] <@karen> For my marketing plan, I started with an outline of what I wanted to include (from the week 2 course page) and then am just filling in parts as I have them.
[12:28] <@karen> Yes, it would be interesting to talk to some restaurants or others who might be customers and see where they are getting their photos now
[12:28] <cris_> we have found that: http://www.salesucre.ch/cgi-bin/WebObjects/salesucre.woa/wa/receipes
[12:28] <cris_> I think they are Frennch
[12:28] <cris_> French
[12:29] <@karen> Yes. I see lots of recipes there. Recipes are so much easier to use with good photos.
[12:30] <@karen> Maybe cookbooks would be another market for you.
[12:30] <cris_> yes!! it would be great
[12:30] <cris_> but it's not easy...
[12:31] <@karen> True
[12:31] <cris_> we should find the editorial
[12:31] <@karen> Yes. I think partnerships with cooks or restaurants are very important
[12:31] <@karen> Are there any cooking clubs or gourmet stores you might find?
[12:31] <cris_> yes...
[12:32] <@karen> Facebook and Twitter are good ways to connect with people with specific interests like cooking
[12:32] <cris_> The problem is that here, the Mediterranean cuisine it's not new
[12:33] <cris_> yes! maybe we can use twitter or FB to find companies outside...
[12:33] <@karen> Maybe you could do some kind of "new" twist on Mediterranean cuisine ?
[12:33] <cris_> outside is were we can offer a "different" product
[12:34] <@karen> Or market other places (Even here in the U.S. Mediterranean is pretty common)
[12:34] <cris_> yes!! it's a good idea!!
[12:34] <cris_> really? is common for you too?
[12:34] <@karen> A content partner -- like a restaurant or a cook -- might help you find that new twist
[12:35] <@karen> We eat a lot of tapas, hummus, baba ganoush, olives, couscous, fritattas -- is this the kind of Mediterranean food you mean?
[12:36] <cris_> no
[12:36] <@karen> Do you know José Andrés and the "Made in Spain" show? We love him!
[12:36] <cris_> couscous is also mediterranean... but.... it's more arabic
[12:37] <cris_> no... i don't know José Andres
[12:37] <cris_> have you tasted paella?
[12:37] <@karen> Yes, we love paella.
[12:37] <cris_> :-)
[12:37] <@karen> Here's a link to José Andrés: http://www.pbs.org/madeinspain/
[12:38] <@karen> Do you have people who focus on "fusion" food there? It's a mix of different traditions, like Asian and Californian.
[12:38] <@karen> It's "new" and different
[12:39] <cris_> woooow!! josé Andrés!! my God!!
[12:39] <cris_> spanglish!!
[12:39] <cris_> it's funny!!
[12:39] <@karen> He is very funny!
[12:40] <@karen> We watch his show on television.
[12:40] <cris_> he is also on tv??
[12:40] <@karen> One of the best parts is all the video footage from Spain and stories about the culture there.
[12:40] <cris_> Oh my God!!
[12:40] <@karen> It is food but also travel and culture
[12:40] <@karen> Maybe this is a new angle you could think about?
[12:40] <@karen> It's a great "export" product.
[12:41] <@karen> Maybe you could shoot video for someone elsewhere that wanted to do something like this
[12:41] <@karen> Do I remember that you work in public television?
[12:41] <cris_> yes
[12:41] <@karen> José Andrés is on public television (PBS) here.
[12:42] <cris_> wow!!
[12:42] <cris_> the problem is that in our tv is complicated because it's a public tv
[12:42] <@karen> Maybe there is some kind of public television partnership for you. Does your public television do food shows?
[12:42] <cris_> and we have our workplace and...
[12:42] <@karen> Internet might be easier than television.
[12:43] <cris_> it has a food program every day
[12:43] <cris_> yes! definitly, it must be on the internet
[12:43] <@karen> I think most shows are going to the Internet anyway. Do you know Hulu?
[12:43] <cris_> no
[12:43] <@karen> You might need to look for an Internet channel (like YouTube) but that pays the producer
[12:44] <@karen> Hulu is television shows that you watch on the Internet http://www.hulu.com/
[12:44] <@karen> I don't know what the economic model is though
[12:44] <cris_> I'll have a look at all this recomandations!! it's very interesting!
[12:45] <@karen> Do you know Associated Content? They pay for content. You might read this and look at their site. http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/339029/expo_tv_easy_way_to_make_extra_money.html
[12:45] <@karen> Any other questions about your marketing plan or the course?
[12:46] <cris_> no!!
[12:46] <cris_> for the moment that's all
[12:47] <@karen> OK. Thanks for being on the chat! (Sorry others weren't here. We had a bigger group on Thursday.
[12:47] <cris_> oh! it's a pity
[12:47] <@karen> I'll post a log of this chat under "Chat logs" in the course materials.
[12:47] <@karen> I have fun talking with you and thinking about food!
[12:47] <cris_> but it has been very profitalble!!
[12:47] <@karen> :)
[12:47] <cris_> thank you Karen!!
[12:48] <cris_> it has been great!!
[12:48] <@karen> Thank you. I'll post future chat times in the "course admin msgs" section of the forum.
[12:48] <cris_> do you live near flagstaff?
[12:48] <@karen> I'm south of there....about a five or six hour drive.
[12:48] <cris_> the distances are very long!!
[12:49] <cris_> we stayed in Flagstff
[12:49] <@karen> The U.S. is a huge country! We fly a lot.
[12:49] <@karen> Did you ski there?
[12:49] <cris_> last year
[12:49] <cris_> no...
[12:49] <cris_> but it was snowing a lot
[12:49] <cris_> the weather channel was ther
[12:49] <@karen> Oh. Nice. Did you get to see the Grand Canyon?
[12:49] <cris_> 24 hours there, all covered of snow
[12:50] <cris_> yes
[12:50] <@karen> If you're ever here again, let me know. We love to have visitors!
[12:50] <cris_> one of the best things I've ever seen
[12:50] <cris_> we visited death valley, Las Vegas, Antelope Canyon
[12:50] <cris_> San Francisco
[12:51] <@karen> Death Valley is nice. I lived in California for many years
[12:51] <cris_> it's impressive!!
[12:51] <cris_> it's a good place to live!!
[12:51] <@karen> I haven't been to Spain but hope to go. I have a friend who goes back adn forth between the U.S. and Spain.
[12:51] <@karen> and
[12:52] <cris_> we have nice things, but you have big things!!! Here in Spain is all small!!
[12:52] <@karen> But beautiful! I love the ocean.
[12:53] <@karen> I like all the history in Europe. Everything here is very new
[12:53] <cris_> Yes, we have interesting history....
[12:53] <cris_> historic buildings
[12:53] <@karen> Art and culture
[12:53] <cris_> but your nature is.... GREAT!!
[12:54] <@karen> I live in a place now with lots of nature and animals. It is very rural but beautiful.
[12:54] <cris_> that's good!!
[12:54] <cris_> I live in a small village
[12:54] <cris_> no noise...
[12:54] <cris_> it's quiet
[12:54] <@karen> I like small towns (especially after living in Los Angeles).
[12:54] <cris_> wow!!
[12:55] <cris_> Los Angele!!
[12:55] <@karen> I don't like the crowds and noise
[12:55] <@karen> I liked it when I lived there, but now I like the quiet!
[12:55] <cris_> neither do I
[12:55] <cris_> me too!
[12:55] <@karen> And with the Internet, we can access almost anything here.
[12:55] <cris_> quiet is better
[12:55] <@karen> I also travel a lot.
[12:55] <cris_> that's true!!
[12:56] <@karen> Well, have a great week! And I'll hope to see you on chat again soon.
[12:56] <cris_> the same to you!!
