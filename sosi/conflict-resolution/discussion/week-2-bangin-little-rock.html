    <p>This week&#39;s homework was to watch the documentary <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk7iFwE5QSM&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=fvwp" rel="nofollow">&quot;Bangin&#39; in Little Rock&quot;</a> and to read the articles <a href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/human_needs/" rel="nofollow">&quot;Unmet Human Needs&quot;</a> and <a href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/escalation/" rel="nofollow">&quot;Destructive Escalation.&quot;</a></p>
<p>I selected this video because it is a great introduction to real-life conflict resolution, and gangs are a problem in many communities worldwide. The following discussion questions can be used in your discussion groups, and you are also invite to share your thoughts by responding to this thread. You do not necessarily need to answer all of the questions (though you are welcome to), and if you have other ideas you would like to share in regard to this week&#39;s learning resources, all of your input is welcome!</p>
<ul>
<li>
		We learned from this film that people can help defuse conflict without necessarily having a background in conflict resolution. What skills and values are necessary for someone to be an effective conflict resolver?</li>
<li>
		What techniques does Steve Nawojczyk, the county coroner, use to deal with the gang situation in Little Rock? Why do you think these techniques are successful?</li>
<li>
		What reasons do people in the film give for joining gangs? Do these reasons fit in with the theories you read in the article? How do you get your needs met differently from the people who joined gangs?</li>
<li>
		How did the gang situation in Little Rock escalate? How did it de-escalate?</li>

    <p>Watching Bangin in Little rock validates the theories that apart from basic needs, there are other needs such as belonginess,/love, safety, se;f esteem and identity as expalined by Sarah Marker in her article: Umet Human Needs. OG in the film he carries gun because it is better to be safe than sorry.Most of the gang members form both Crips and Blood affirmed belonginess as one reason that made that join gangs. Membership of gang filled their yearning for love and family. L.A Moe joined when he was young because it is a tradition. These youngsters know no better, although they see a lot of their friends and family killed in gang wars the gang had a greater pull by filling those gaps in who they are. These personal conflict can be better resolved by third parties giving them the third view as well as alternative choices.</p>

    <p>__Skills and Values necessary to be an effective conflict resolver__<br />
•	Steve Nawojczyk displayed compassion. He was touched to a personal level from what he encounters at his work. He felt that he needed to do something from the bottom of his heart, with no hidden agenda. I like how he personally goes and visits the neighbourhoods and bonds with some of the gang members. He also treated them like people, and with respect. He listened to them. I also like the part when Nawojczyk was talking to a group but by the end only one guy was responding. But that one guy promised he’ll talk to his friends that have connections to other gangs and try to resolve arguments from within.<br />
•	The pastor that started the truce flag was also touched at a personal level. He feels the pain of the crying mothers and their families. He sees how it’s splitting the neighbourhood more and more apart. He also felt the calling to do something and he did… he talked to different groups and also listened to them. He brought some of them to the balcony by letting them realize that they need to talk to solve problems… not point and shoot.</p>
<p>__ Resolution Techniques__<br />
•	Steve Nawojczyk placed pictures of victims and told stories of individuals that were badly hurt by the gang wars. He went into each neighbourhood in plain clothes and approached the kids. He allowed the kids to relate themselves to the victims by showing them the pictures and asking them to help identify the victims. He told everyone the damage gang wars are causing and discouraged them by letting them see that these people they’re shooting are fellow neighbours with families.</p>
<p>__Reason for Joining Gangs__<br />
•	As Winifred mentioned, they join for the sense of family. Their need to belong and identify with a group is met. They feel that they are invisible as long as they’re with their family… and they also feel that if anyone else threatens them they must respond by retaliation to avenge their family. They also feel that they are accepted as who they are and they are not pushed away like they would at home with their real families.</p>
<p>__Gang War Escalation and De-escalation__<br />
•	It escalated through a sense of revenge. It shows signs of a conflict (retaliatory) spiral model from week 1 reading, where the mentality is centred in anger and to “teach them a lesson”.<br />
•	More gangs are involved as gangs assume another gang to be the initiator.<br />
•	De-escalation began when 3rd parties, with no bias to any gang, are involved. Steve Nawojczyk’s efforts to calm the gangs and the pastor’s efforts to spread the truce was the start. People began to openly show their support for the truce by displaying a white flag and it was a symbolic gesture for them to stop killing.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Violence seems to be a "easier" answer to a lot of problems over talking/resolving the problems. This is especially so when revenge has taken over our sense of purpose, when people don't know what else to do.</p>
<p>To a lesser scale, we can observe similar behaviour in our daily life. We get angry when someone does us wrong. If we let that emotion take over us, we will retaliate.</p>
<p>Like in the video, having a third party help mediate is very useful - arbitration.</p>
<p>* We learned from this film that people can help defuse conflict without necessarily having a background in conflict resolution. What skills and values are necessary for someone to be an effective conflict resolver?<br />
•	They are determined and willing to take actions to make a change to the better.<br />
•	They talk to the gang members and give them an alternative - talk vs. kill.<br />
•	The pastor has status in community. He calls upon his congregation/the community to act. He takes the initiative to reach out to the gangs to stop the violence/call a truce.<br />
•	To defuse a conflict, someone needs to take the first step.<br />
* What techniques does Steve Nawojczyk, the county coroner, use to deal with the gang situation in Little Rock? Why do you think these techniques are successful?<br />
•	He shows them how bad it can be (being shot to dead) – the results of violence or actions. He uses pictures to facilitate his communication of his message. Picture is worth thousand words. He tells them what he has experienced - results of violence. He uses what his audience can relate to and appreciate.<br />
•	He also listens to the gang members and shows them that people care about them; society reaches out and touches them<br />
* What reasons do people in the film give for joining gangs? Do these reasons fit in with the theories you read in the article? How do you get your needs met differently from the people who joined gangs?<br />
•	Broken families. Love and respect. Money and meeting material needs. Be like someone powerful/status. They are looking for self-esteem – as someone to look up to instead of feeling helpless when things happened to them or around them.<br />
•	They don't know any other better alternatives than joining a gang.<br />
* How did the gang situation in Little Rock escalate? How did it de-escalate?<br />
•	Hate and anger feeds itself increasingly to a point that the situation is ready to explode. After a while, they kill for the sake of kill and do not knowing the reason why. Killing has become just the thing to do.<br />
•	The human emotion for revenge/retaliation is strong.<br />
•	After the situation has boiled to a peak point, people become tired of the violence but don't know what else to do.<br />
•	Community also has enough and acts to stop the violence. People start to reach out to the gangs and urge them to call a truce. People get the gang members talking to solve problems.</p>

I really respect Steve's position that he can't just sit around and let it happen, he feels compelled to do something to help.  I do think we could all learn something about stepping outside of our comfort zones to effect a positive change.  Although I realize that this may be easier for some.</p>
<p>What skills and values are necessary for someone to be an effective conflict resolver?  Listening skills are very important.  Also a real desire to see the conflict come to an end.  Respect and an open mind are imperative to anyone in the field of conflict resolution.</p>
<p>•What techniques does Steve Nawojczyk, the county coroner, use to deal with the gang situation in Little Rock? He listens to the gang members, instead of just talking/preaching to them.  He aslo shows real examples of what can happen (pictures of victims), that some community members were able to recognize. </p>
<p>Why do you think these techniques are successful?  Because it is obvious that he cares, he doesn't see these people as a statistic, or some distant person.  He connects with them, in any way he can.</p>
<p>•What reasons do people in the film give for joining gangs?  Love, belonging and protection.  I hadn't really thought of gangs before, and I found these reasons to join heartbreaking.  </p>
<p>Do these reasons fit in with the theories you read in the article? They definately fit.  We are all connected, and all have the same needs.  Who knows where/how we would be if those needs had never been met in our entire lives, ever!</p>
<p>How do you get your needs met differently from the people who joined gangs?  I am fortuate to live in a secure country/environment.  However there have been times that certain fundamental needs weren't met.  Sometimes I acted out, drinking, and hanging out with people I shouldn't have.  Reading has been key to me in opening my mind and heart.  I have been fortunate to have a great network of friends.  </p>
<p>•How did the gang situation in Little Rock escalate?  Nobody seemed to be willing to just let it go.  How did it de-escalate?  I have to think that it must have mattered to some of the residents that Steve &amp; co. did care.  Maybe their parents/familes weren't in a position to be whet they needed and deserved, but others do care.  A stranger, someone you don't know caring is a powerful message.</p>
<p>I want to say thanks again for the eye opener.  I can't imagine the devestating state of feeling hopeless.</p>

    <p>I think the characteristics necessary to be a mediator are empathy, openness, honesty, approach to the problems to be solved and patience.</p>
<p>Nawojczyk tries to understand the problem and to extent the situation to all involved, neighbors and family. I think much of his success is a personal commitment to reduce crime, based on what he can see in his daily work.</p>
<p>Reasons for joining gangs could fit into the needs of cultural security, belonging and identity.</p>
<p>The escalation of the gang was mainly due to a conflict spiral model, possibly due to the need for revenge. It de-escalate through the involvement of third parties to reach a truce.</p>

    <p>* We learned from this film that people can help defuse conflict without necessarily having a background in conflict resolution. What skills and values are necessary for someone to be an effective conflict resolver?</p>
<p>I think what's required is trust and a common ground to talk about as well as a listening ear and to keep in mind of what are the things that cannot be compromised to the other party and lastly, not to call the opposition wrong or insult them at any 1 time.</p>
<p>    * What techniques does Steve Nawojczyk, the county coroner, use to deal with the gang situation in Little Rock? Why do you think these techniques are successful?</p>
<p>In the video, the Steve Nawojczyk &amp; the gangs had 1 common point in common. They are both sick of seeing their friends/gang mates dying uneccessarily &amp; the fear that their day may come soon. He is also willing to listen to them, coming to find them personally himself to talk with them, connect with their thoughts.</p>
<p>    * What reasons do people in the film give for joining gangs? Do these reasons fit in with the theories you read in the article? How do you get your needs met differently from the people who joined gangs?</p>
<p>Some reasons they gave are the needs for a sense of belonging. Indeed, to feel needed &amp; loved is very essential for survival.</p>
<p>As an introvert myself, I'm often alone &amp; felt I need some company to my lonely life. However, I had my family to thanks for always being so supportive of me. If not for them, I do not know where I will be now. I might join a gang.</p>
<p>    * How did the gang situation in Little Rock escalate? How did it de-escalate?</p>
<p>It start to escalate due to the killings, people are mad to see their fellow mates killed. this turn to hatred and they start to revenge and it grows bigger. People will always remember that the other party did something terrible to their gang mates and they need to do justice for their friends</p>
<p>It de escalate due to all having a common ground of the fear of being shot as well as not wanting to see their friends leave them as Steve &amp; others pointed out to them.</p>
<p>Overall, I must say the documentry is really an eye opener. I thought I have seen enough of gang &amp; bullies but what I have seen in this video is out of this world for me. Definately much worse than the situation over here.</p>
<p>PS: I find some of the resources links to be really ugly and near impossible to read. Thankfully, this bookmarklet reduces my pain. I hope it can be helpful to you too! <a href="http://www.notforest.com/" title="http://www.notforest.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notforest.com/</a></p>
