  <div class="content">
    <p>Greetings, All. I just returned from a graduate seminar, called, "Embodying the Dream: Imagination, Intuition, and Inner Knowing," and today I find myself "re-integrating" all that I learned. As a graduate student of transpersonal psychology, I am spending each day facing my spiritual being.  What has inspired me to create the Mindful Transformation project comes directly from the "wisdom approaches" I have received daily in my transpersonal psychology coursework. This morning while I was reading from a book called, "Modern Psychology and Ancient Wisdom: Pathological Healing Practices from the World's Religious Traditions (Author: Sharon G. Mijares PhD)," I knew instantly that I had to share what I was reading with this group.<br />
"Buddhist psychology has much to offer the Western world. Very few persons live fully engaged in the present moment. A friend comes to visit, but the visit is continually interrupted as the friend answers pager messages. In cars, stores, workshops, and airports, people talk on cellular phones. We are fragmented people living in a fragmented society. Buddhism teaches mindfulness. Its practitioner learns to be present in each moment, thought, feeling, and movement." What I hope to accomplish with you in the Sustainability Studio is the "felt sense" that in working together, side by side, that we are "present" for each other and "present" for ourselves as we learn more about our passion to do the "good" work that we do. I feel truly humbled to be experiencing this with you.<br />
I am currently living in Silver Spring, MD and a graduate student of transpersonal psychology at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, Palo Alto, CA. I have had the  opportunity to work in Rwanda, Africa for the non-profit organization, One Laptop per Child, and I also helped to start up the international office of the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund USA in Boston. These two particular jobs helped me to realize that I am but a small part of a "greater unity."<br />
I share the movement of these words by Bill Plotkin, "...our yearning for individual personal meaning and a way to contribute to life, a yearning that pulls us toward the heart of the world – down, that is, into wild nature..."<br />
I am also a yoga practitioner for nearly 8 years now and am consciously nurturing a sitting meditation practice.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Hello. After returning home to my farm after a morning run and swim at the beach it would be easy to turn off to the world and its ills and just enjoy what I have. Yet I, like around 6 billion others, also have the very human need to continually improve and make the world a better place. Now that piece of rhetoric also has around 6 billion interpretations. Yet one simple maxim I follow is that we don't trash the planet or each other. Living that maxim in itself would be a huge turn around from current global practices.</p>
<p>So with that simple interpretation of sustainability in mind I can implement my own little plan to 'save' the world :-) And it operates 24/7.</p>
<p>That also ties in with another of my beliefs that we all must do our bit. As a confirmed atheist I can't abdicate my responsibilities to the planet and others in the crazy belief that heaven or a saviour will rescue me/us. What you see is what you get.</p>
<p>This however does not negate the power of spirituality. As I have watched my rainforest of 4,000 trees rise from the grass of a disused dairy farm over the past sixteen years I have become more spiritual by the day. I am continually in awe of the power and gentleness and the brutality and intelligence of nature. And the fact that my simple actions taken all those years ago have exponentially increased the life and well being that this piece of land now supports.</p>
<p>Then when I need some sport and cash I go out and work with fucked up companies as an organisational change manager. Isn't life great?</p>

    <p>Hi everyone, my original intent when I signed up for this course was to use it to help develop a project I have been working on in D.C. to start a local account of wellbeing.  I have interviewed many people over the last year, and built a team with several members coming and going over that time.  I still believe that project has a real need, but we are still struggling to find the leverage point in the system to get started!  So I just want to briefly describe that project and hear your thoughts on it, but I may actually have a different proposal for what I want to use this course to work on (see the final paragraph).</p>
<p>The biggest challenge of getting a true grassroots account of wellbeing going in our mind is that it needs to be geographically defined, not limited to the constituency of a single organization.  Getting access to and buy-in from an entire community to scientifically survey within a geographical area is going to be a real feat that, we have realized, needs support from local government.  We are working on connections with the local Area Neighborhood Committees (ANCs), but progress is slow.</p>
<p>The aim of all of this is very simple: we would like development and policy proposals, and the impact of local businesses's on the local community, to be able to be reported against a local map of wellbeing in each neighborhood of D.C.  Just like is done by the Bhutanese Gross National Happiness, a development proposal should be able to submit a "Wellbeing Impact Statement" saying how they anticipate that their development will impact known stresses on and assets for wellbeing in the community.  This seems so obvious to us; at a local hearing on a 10-story hotel going into a historic neighborhood, where there are currently no structure over three stories, all that was discussed was impact on tax revenue.  What about fabric of the community??  There was no basis for this discussion to even happen, much less play a role in the final outcome by the city council.</p>
<p>Recently, we have turned our thinking to smaller demonstrations we could use to get started, such as a mobile-phone based survey we could promote through local partners to ping users with random questions to create a living pulse of wellbeing in the community, or a series of workshops to discuss assets and barriers to wellbeing in our neighborhoods, or conducting a survey within a smaller community like a school, or collecting non-scientific "convenient samples" by just walking around one day!</p>
<p>More on that project: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrAKsJ-pzrgTkrjd1MOUAQ31ZIKNHqRWhtCku02DWAc/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CKeK0dMD" title="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrAKsJ-pzrgTkrjd1MOUAQ31ZIKNHqRWhtCku02DWAc/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CKeK0dMD" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrAKsJ-pzrgTkrjd1MOUAQ31ZIKNHqRWhtCk...</a></p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not I will be able to use this course to make significant progress on this project, and I welcome your ideas or input!  Either way, I would like to propose a smaller, more concrete project for this course, and invite participation from any of you:</p>
<p>I would like to develop a rubric for a badge (or a few badges?) to reward commitments to and demonstrations of love in the world... love of your neighbor, love of yourself, love of the planet?  This could include interviews and literature reviews on compassion and love from different religions, from positive psychology, and from other sources, and collaboratively editing a rubric with you all for evaluating many types of possible evidence anyone could submit to earn this badge.  What do you all think?  Anyone want to help?</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Alan</p>

    <p>Alan, thinking about your well-being initiative - do you know Marcus Foth in Australia? <a href="http://www.vrolik.de/" title="http://www.vrolik.de/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrolik.de/</a><br />

<p>His speciality is urban informatics with sustainability and creativity dimensions. I'll bet he has some ideas for how you could get started with something using mobile technologies. Let me know if you'd like me to invite him to join a live studio session. </p>

    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I was at the graduate seminar in California last week with Joy.  Due to a medical emergency with my husband I had to leave a few hours early and stayed at the hospital with my husband for the six days that he was there; I have been unable to participate in this project much as of yet.  Things are improving so I should be available now :)</p>
<p>Like Joy I am excited about the Being Mindful project.  The world could be a much better place if we would be more mindful of our actions and be present in each moment.  I have always had a deep connection to my spirituality - never felt overly comfortable within any one given religion, but yet I know the spiritual connection is there and runs deep.  </p>
<p>I taught dance for over twenty years.  I earned my undergrad degree in psychology.  And, now I am completing my grad work in Transpersonal Psych at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in CA.  My husband and I have started a new company, Inward Oasis, which focuses on bridging the gap between one's spirituality and day-to-day living and therefore being able to recognize and nurture the spirit of a couple (when in a relationship, of course).  To do these things we must be mindful.  Mindfulness can help connect you, lift you up, keep you grounded, and bring joy into your life.  I have found that it also brings the Divine into your life - whatever or however you perceive that.</p>
<p>Sharing with others the benefits of Being Mindful and ways to do just that is very important to me.  As Joy often says, it brings about a "call to action" for us.  </p>
<p>Love to All,<br />
Janelle</p>

    <p>Hi everyone. Sorry for being absent of late. </p>
<p>I'm currently working on a number of things, mostly in the community college sector at the moment. I'm starting a fairly large and timely online resource relative to community college issues, trends and strategies. </p>
<p>One of my passions is related to what I call the four pathways toward happiness (or contentment): health, self-sufficient, purpose and love. </p>
<p>I'm finding the posts within this "introduce yourself" forum very much tied to the pathways. Wellbeing, being mindful, being engaged in the present and Paul's post about sustaining his life in the hard world when he is not thoroughly enjoying life in nature - these are all wonderful places to start some great discussions.</p>
<p>In any event, back to my introduction: My livelihood is sustained (with many rough patches) through writing lots of nonfiction that is relative to the education sector. I also have a great novel in my head that is based on the life of St. Francis of Assisi. </p>
<p>Some of the primary topics in the education sector that I am tracking (in addition to a very broad scope about community colleges) include information literacy, open education resources, the globalization of education, online education, assessment,governance and eportfolios.</p>
<p>Best,<br />
George</p>

    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I'm the Chris Geith groupie in the shadows listening with the goal of contributing when I can be useful.</p>
<p>My blessing is insatiable curiosity. I will never be able to know enough things about enough things, to understand enough things about enough things, or to share enough things about enough things.</p>
<p>I am a curator; a collector of knowledge; a connector of people.</p>
<p>I believe we(humans) have the ability to save the world or to destroy it. I believe there will always be people trying to do both and saviors must prevail.</p>
<p>For me sustainability has many meanings: environmental, social, political, economic, and on and on.  I want to learn more from you about your ideas for sustainability and to interject when I can to challenge or support you.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you in the cloud. (I'll try to get a photo up next...)<br />
Paul</p>

    <p>Good morning everyone. I'm reading your introductions - drinking my coffee on a snow-covered morning with the sun coming up pink - and I'm touched by what you've written and shared here. Wow! The synergies between your interests has soooo much potential. </p>
<p>How is it that I came to know each of you? </p>
<p>Joy I first met you over 12 years ago when you served as the much-loved secretariat for NUTN, which was the first distance learning association in the U.S. <a href="http://nutn.org/" title="http://nutn.org/" rel="nofollow">http://nutn.org/</a> Joy, you are onto something, because your way of being in the world keeps you perpetually rejuvinated  - what's your secret!?</p>
<p>Paul McKey, I've known you about the same length of time -  when I discovered your master's thesis online about "the total student experience" <a href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/brisbane99/papers/mckey.pdf" title="http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/brisbane99/papers/mckey.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/brisbane99/papers/mckey.pdf</a>. Turns out you were the CTO of a company that my former university eventually joined forces with to create the Global University Alliance (this is so defunct that when I search for the old GUA web site I see that it is now the Gremlins Umbrella Authority!). Your vision is still thriving in your book and PhD work - and in your paintings.</p>
<p>Alan Webb, we just recently met - in December I believe - when our mutual friend Ahrash told me about you. In a 45-minute call we caught up on about a decade of ideas! I love the citizen circle model <a href="http://www.citizencircles.com/" title="http://www.citizencircles.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.citizencircles.com/</a> And, we are all here in Sustainability Studio thanks in large part to that call.</p>
<p>Janelle - we've met on the phone through Joy - where I learned about the new business you and your husband are starting in mindfulness/well-being - I'm glad you are with us and I look forward to getting to know you better. </p>
<p>George, wow - I think you and I met 15 years ago when you first decided to start writing about distance/online learning. It's wonderful to see how that has blossomed for you. I'm glad to think you are reading this in sunny California instead of snowy Buffalo right now. </p>
<p>Paul "PieUp" - thank you Marti - for introducing us. You are one of the big idea people here in the area - and into art as well! If any of you want a daily dose of the best in innovation, leadership and learning - let Paul know and he'll put you on his update list. Also, check out this video of Paul's PieUp presentation from my department's 10-year symposia <a href="http://msuglobal.com/2011/02/symposia-pie-ups/" title="http://msuglobal.com/2011/02/symposia-pie-ups/" rel="nofollow">http://msuglobal.com/2011/02/symposia-pie-ups/</a></p>
<p>Now, we are all here working on sustainability issues together! And, there are more people that each of us has brought along that are also participating in one way or another in our projects. Invite your friends to join us here in the forum so we can all benefit from hearing their stories. </p>
<p>I'm really inspired by each of you. Thanks for getting my Sunday off to a great start!</p>
<p>I'll be talking to some of you, I hope, in the live session tomorrow at 4:00 pm with Karl Gude - he's someone you won't want to miss!</p>
<p>- Chris</p>
