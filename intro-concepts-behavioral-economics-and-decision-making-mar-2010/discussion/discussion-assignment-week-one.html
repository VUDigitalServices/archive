    <p>Hi everyone. Is this the right place to comment? I hope I'm not missing a discussion taking place somewhere else on the site.</p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoyed the video and readings, and it seemed to be addressing two different (probably related) issues. On the one hand, the readings seemed to be about the limits of unrealistic, abstract, mathematical economic theories, which don't reflect how humans really behave. I don't know enough about traditional economics to know whether this is a valid criticism of all economists, or many of them. However, it does seem likely that psychology, history, sociology might have something to add to our understanding of human behaviour, alongside the mathematical models. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Thaler's video seemed to be about using the technique of the 'nudge' in public policy. It's an interesting approach, and probably works well in many contexts, but I'm not sure that it's the answer to every problem. He wants to be 'libertarian' by 'preserving choice' and 'paternalist' by giving people what they say they want. But sometimes there are hard questions in public policy about what choices should be permitted, and what should not. Sometimes a nudge may work better than a ban, but not always. Also, this seems like a very funny way to use the word 'paternalist'. To me, paternalism means that you know what is best for someone else. I agree that we should try to find out what people want, and use 'choice architecture' to help them achieve it, but I also think there might be times when we need paternalism in its stronger form, recognising that there are certain things which are good for people, whether they want them or not. Perhaps we should sometimes nudge people to persuade them to want the things that are good for them, as well as making it easier for them to choose the things they already want?</p>
<p>Anyway, those are my first thoughts. Looking forward to further discussion.<br />
Phil</p>

    <p>It's interesting to what degree we have agency. I believe in the Thaler video he talks about defaults. It's funny that we make such different choices based on whether something is an option or a default. While we as people/citizens/consumers feel we have agency when context matters so much you have to wonder how much agency we really have.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Yeah. I don't think recognising the importance of context means that we cannot have agency. After all, decisions are always made in particular contexts, which influence, but don't necessarily dictate, our choices. The 'BE' approach seems to be a reaction to the context-free abstractions of (some) traditional economics. But haven't economists always been aware of things like transaction costs, inertia, brand loyalty etc? I suppose that the difference is that traditional economics regarded these things as market 'inefficiencies' whereas BE takes them as facts of human nature, which can be used in various ways.</p>

    <p>The thing is someone has to set up the decision context. So how do you decide? You have to go one way or another. Say you're a grocery store and you know that people are more likely to buy the products that are placed at eye level. You can 1. choose to randomly put products in different locations, 2. put high margin products at eye level which are also usually processed junk food, or 3. put healthy food at eye level. Say you are the grocer: what would you do?</p>

    <p>Well, part of the answer to Valerie's excellent question might be that if you asked people whether they would prefer the food to be arranged to maximise profit for the retailer, or to promote health for themselves, they'd probably choose healthy. But they might also say that a random selection would be better if they don't want to feel like they are being manipulated, even if it is for their own good. Thaler seems to be emphasising that 'nudges' can help people to choose to do the things they say they want to do - eat healthier, save more, etc. Is it manipulation if you're helping people to get what they say they want?</p>

    <p>There's an even more interesting philosophical question here. Marketing is all about getting people to buy your stuff (positioning, advertising, etc.). It's inherent in business to be competitive in a capitalistic system. So at what point does doing business (which as a society we think is good) become manipulation? Look at all of Apple's products. So much of it is about constructing an identity that we all want to be part of.</p>

    <p>I think there may be some cultural differences as to whether we think 'business is good' and whether we think that anything which governments do must be treated with enormous suspicion, and carefully controlled. I tend to be equally suspicious of corporate motives (although I think that well-regulated markets and accountable government are both necessary parts of a democracy). The US healthcare debate is interesting to me. In the UK, we prefer a publicly funded healthcare system, rather than one run by for-profit corporations. In the US, there's much more willingness to trust the private market, and not even allow people to choose a 'public option'.</p>

    <p>On the eve of the US health care bill passage, one wonders how most Americans would describe the provision that requires millions to get health care insurance.  A 'nudge'?  Or something a tad stronger?  Maybe Sunstein and Thaler should have named their book 'Shove'?  </p>
<p>Personally I'm glad to see a strong governmental presence in health care.  But unfortunately that's also an idea many Americans are allergic to.  It's interesting how a similar set of policies can create very different reactions from one country to another, depending on varying value structures.  This would not create nearly such a stir in the UK, for example...</p>

    <p>Ha! I love the comment about shove. But we can ask the same question as to why we are required to go to school until a certain point. It's good for individuals and it's good for society but you are kind of forced into it. I think there's such a weird visceral reaction to anything that looks remotely socialist in this country not based on anything objective. It could even be because it threatens a fundamental identity of being American.</p>

    <p>The problem isn't the idea of universal health care - pretty much everyone agrees that it is shameful that a country that is willing to spend so much money on lavish lifestyles and military deployment beyond its own borders can still have millions of citizens without any health care at any cost. Many Americans think that systems like those in the UK and Canada may not be perfect, but everyone is reasonably well served and nobody goes without access to basic health care. </p>
<p>Some Americans get health care that is the best in the world, and far more health care than they actually want or need. Many people have minimal coverage in case of a catastrophic illness or injury but don't get routine checkups because the out-of-pocket for all the tests and diagnostics and preventative medications are too expensive. Still others depend on hospital emergency services as their only source of medical care.</p>
<p>Many Americans believe that the Obama health care reform will only make matters worse for most people. The level of government regulation, intervention and oversight are major concerns for the libertarians AND the paternalists among us.</p>

    <p>There is so much meddling by governments - federal, state and local, in all areas of the US economy that it is difficult to see how a genuinely free market economy would handle these social and cultural issues.</p>
<p>Health care is a great example. "Willingness to trust the private market" - well, no not really. Government regulation has played a large but largely un-noticed role in defining what health care and coverage is available. Only with government support could the few primary providers control most health care spending by individuals, companies and government.</p>

    <p>I think a true free market system has been shot down. Look at the financial crisis. People are very short sighted. That said, I think people don't acknowledge how much governments are needed to set up the rules of the game. Without laws, regulations, and even things like subsidies I don't think business could operate in the first place.</p>

    <p>I dont agree. After all isn't it an insight of Thaler that the way the choice is framed is paramount for the outcome? </p>
<p>If you put in place new/more regulations, that means that the framework has been altered and all the players will adapt to the new framework in order to go back to business as usual. Since, AFAIK, BE also analyses morality issues for explaining some behaviors, we must have in mind, that being "too big to fail" introduces a colossal moral hazard. Imagine running (down) a business and knowing that no matter what I'll do, the obliging taxpayer will be there for me when the going gets tough.</p>

    <p>I think that some issues like emotions are very important, surround some markets and governments: fear to lose, fear to risks, and in some occasions they are reflected to the policies, problems derivates from that: corruption, etc. Sometimes the good information (complete information) precedes a good decision for one person but not necessarily for a group of persons.</p>

    <p>I think one the key learnings of behavioral economics is that our emotions play a much larger role in our decision making than any kind of rationality. The emotional part of our brain is much older, stronger, and influential over our decision making than we care to acknowledge. Sometimes its influence is conscious but often it's not. That said, we're not totally out of control :)</p>

    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I hope I'm not too late too participate in the discussion for week 1 (late start due to another course ending, sorry :D).</p>
<p>I think that the Thaler speech was tailored to the Google audience. They are developers in need of understanding user behavior in order to create the best "choice architecture" for them. Users online do not follow patterns, nor do they follow the utility law. At least not in an obvious way. It's the same pattern with the economic agents, at least the individual ones. Macro agents (governments, businesses) still need to take the rational approach (or at least, the way Thaler puts it, a paternalistic libertarianism), as it's the reigning paradigm. </p>
<p>However, the behavioral component remains very important, as always when you have humans involved. They do not chose rationally, and this is a topic I am very interested in discussing during this course. They obviously do so because there is a perceived benefit if they do not take the rational approach. So maybe a point for benefits should be made: What are the benefits that elicit certain behaviors and how could we go about securing them?</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I've watched the video and also listened to a couple of podcasts, one with Richard Thaler himself and another one with Edward Glaeser from econtalk.org.</p>
<p>I find that the way the @google talk is architected does obfuscates some of the issues that soft paternalism, or, the coined terminology of "libertarian paternalism" raises. His dismissal of the slippery slope argument as being unrealistic is quite disingenuous. The obvious example of that being the smoke banning in public places, now being in place in a lot of countries. It started with tax a increase on cigarettes and afterwards the labels stating that tobacco kills, or that tobacco causes impotence, finally at a not very slow pace we arrive at the ban. What next?</p>
<p>I'm not saying that it's commonplace to travel down a slippery slope, but the fact is that it's possible and there are examples to prove it.</p>
<p>I don't have any issue with one of the stated purposes of increased transparency. In fact I'm all for it. Power requires opacity, and increased transparency levels the field between citizens and service providers including government.</p>
<p>And of course the main problem with his plea for the framework of libertarian paternalism is when we apply it in the realm of government action. Call me a cynic but I have no illusions regarding the kindness of government. The government is a monopoly and in that sense is quite the opposite of being a charitable institution. It can perform its functions well or badly, hélas, the later being more common. But it can never be good. It's very dangerous to make moral judgments regarding the actions of a government or any other entity that is providing a service. It goes back to Adam Smith that it's self interest that propels trade, and not any sort of absolute moral righteousness.</p>
<p>People are different and their wishes vary accordingly. How can a bureaucrat, even if  stepped in the most pious of sentiments, know what I want, or what the person across the street wants? What might be good for me, could be anathema to that person. The only solution is to aim for the lowest common denominator. The question then remains who gets to define what that denominator is?<br />
In the private sector there's a market that can nudge the choices made available to move in the right direction, but in government there's no such thing. Since there's a lot of opacity in the process of electing officials and how policies are conceived and put in action.</p>
<p>I also find that his argument that "if something has to be done, then it's better to do it right", as a rationale for soft paternalism owes a lot to a reformist conception of the world, where everything is up for change. Undoubtedly a lot of things in the world can be improved, but other things are better left alone. We have a lot of institutions that have stood the test of time, with a lot of accumulated wisdom in it. Why should we change them?</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the case studies he talks about, both in the video and in the podcast are fascinating and certainly there's much more to economics than mere mechanistic conceptions of the homo economicus and rational choice. But it's not that behavioral economics is the panacea or the theory of everything in economics. It's very useful and insightful but it's a tool in toolkit that incorporates the classical and neoclassical approaches also.</p>

    <p>I'm still trying to work out how to take part in the discussion properly. How is everyone else participating?</p>
<p>Anyway, I've been trying to think about an issue for 'Question 2'. How about paying for care of the elderly? Current options being debated in England include 'free' (ie, paid for out of general taxation), compulsory insurance, extra inheritance taxes (which all seem quite paternalist but not very libertarian), or the (current) system which sometimes forces people to use up their savings or sell their houses to pay for costs of care (quite libertarian, not very paternalist). Does BE help us to find a solution, or combination of solutions, which is both libertarian and paternalist?</p>

<a href="http://uc.princeton.edu/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1257&amp;Itemid=0" title="http://uc.princeton.edu/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1257&amp;Itemid=0" rel="nofollow">http://uc.princeton.edu/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1...</a></p>
<p>As a lawyer myself (and one who has sometimes worked in Government), I think law is always trying to balance libertarian and paternalist impulses. On the one hand, we need law to tell people what to do: 'don't murder', 'get a license and buy insurance if you want to drive', 'don't falsify corporate accounts in order to hide bad debts', etc. On the other hand, law should protect individuals (and maybe corporations too) from being pushed around by the government (and maybe corporations too) without good reason (and we can argue about what counts as a good reason).</p>
<p>Since I think I'm at a quite paternalistic end of the spectrum, I'm really pleased to see other people in the group who are more libertarian. Antonio said:</p>
<p>'The government is a monopoly and in that sense is quite the opposite of being a charitable institution. It can perform its functions well or badly, hélas, the later being more common. But it can never be good. It's very dangerous to make moral judgments regarding the actions of a government or any other entity that is providing a service. It goes back to Adam Smith that it's self interest that propels trade, and not any sort of absolute moral righteousness.'</p>
<p>But my (very limited) understanding is that Smith didn't think that a free market could be self-sustaining. Although individual market transactions may be morally neutral, there has to be a framework of law and morality underpinning the market transactions, otherwise people wouldn't be willing to trade with each other. I'll see if I can track down the quote that I'm thinking of, but maybe someone else already knows it? </p>
<p>Also, why can't something be a charitable monopoly? I may be the only soup kitchen in town, but if I'm feeding the hungry, why can't that be a moral thing to do? Governments certainly aren't always moral, but they can be sometimes - abolishing slavery, declaring war on Nazi Germany, providing help in a disaster. I agree that these things can be done well or badly, but they are also moral choices (sometimes reflecting public opinion, but sometimes going beyond the majority opinion at the time). Government's definitely do bad things, and can make things worse sometimes when they try to do good things, but I don't know how they can be morally neutral, unless they just stop doing anything at all.</p>
<p>I look forward to more lively discussion!</p>

    <p>In relation to the Adam Smith issue, Amartya Sen discusses his view here:<br />
<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22490" title="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22490" rel="nofollow">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22490</a></p>
<p>"... early advocates of the use of markets, including Smith, did not take the pure market mechanism to be a freestanding performer of excellence, nor did they take the profit motive to be all that is needed.<br />
...<br />
He talked about the importance of these broader values that go beyond profits in The Wealth of Nations, but it is in his first book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which was published exactly a quarter of a millennium ago in 1759, that he extensively investigated the strong need for actions based on values that go well beyond profit seeking. While he wrote that "prudence" was "of all the virtues that which is most useful to the individual," Adam Smith went on to argue that "humanity, justice, generosity, and public spirit, are the qualities most useful to others."<br />
Smith viewed markets and capital as doing good work within their own sphere, but first, they required support from other institutions—including public services such as schools—and values other than pure profit seeking, and second, they needed restraint and correction by still other institutions—e.g., well-devised financial regulations and state assistance to the poor—for preventing instability, inequity, and injustice. If we were to look for a new approach to the organization of economic activity that included a pragmatic choice of a variety of public services and well-considered regulations, we would be following rather than departing from the agenda of reform that Smith outlined as he both defended and criticized capitalism."</p>
<p>So maybe Adam Smith was the first libertarian paternalist?</p>

    <p>Adam Smith the libertarian paternalist.  Has a nice ring to it, if I may speak on his behalf.  He's much more commonly associated with free markets and the invisible hand, but it's good to acknowledge that Smith also believed in helping others without necessarily deriving personal gain from the experience (except for maybe the pleasure of seeing someone better off).  </p>
<p>I'm a bit late in picking a topic - I'd like to apply some of the BE principles we discuss in this course towards the issue of lagging student persistence in higher education.  Why do students drop out of school?  What kind of demographic, environmental, institutional, and policy factors contribute to low graduation rates?  And how can we optimize the incentive architecture in the system to minimize this phenomenon?  It's interesting to hold this course up as a data point to think about ways we can promote more active participation and learning among our cohort of 25.  Does engagement have to start early - aka if you don't blog in the first two weeks then you're much more likely to become disengaged?  If so, what can we do to spur and hold your attention?  </p>
<p>I would love any of your thoughts on these questions...</p>

    <p>Hello Ying,</p>
<p>Yes. In fact, in his previous work "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" he talks about sympathy as something to be essential for a functioning society and concomitantly a market.</p>
<p>There's a series of podcasts on the book at the econtalk book club: <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/bookclub.html" title="http://www.econtalk.org/bookclub.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.econtalk.org/bookclub.html</a></p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>As per topic that I would like to address is something very close to my heart, and somewhat painful I should add: "Do public media companies really exist to serve the public and in what sense?"</p>
<p>I had a project that wanted to make available a part of the archives of the portuguese public broadcaster under CC licenses. Inspired by the BBC Creative Archive that, curiously enough, also got terminated. </p>
<p>The project went completely off track when the executives at the broadcaster wanted to make it something much more in line with the organizational culture than trying to serve the public.</p>
<p>I believe that they act in a way that serves them better than they serve the public. In fact I got one of the executives being frank and telling me that "the public service is something totally inconsequential to most decisions made in the company".</p>
<p>I don't think that this is specific to Portugal, I think it's quite common in most European countries. What can BE bring about understanding how the issues of public service and public media companies are related?</p>

    <p>It's hard for me to totally comment on this because we don't really have strong public media companies in the states. Regarding public service, there is this concept called loss aversion. I was trying to find a good "human-readable" reference on it but haven't been able to find anything yet. If anyone out there finds one send it on. Basically the idea is that we hate loss and are way more likely to accept the status quo and avoid risks. Sometimes institutions become wrapped up more in keeping themselves alive and running than doing good for society because people don't want to lose the way things are now. I'm sure there are more concepts we could relate to this. It's a great topic.</p>

    <p>Thank you Neeru: Loss Aversion. That's a new concept for me, I mean in the sense that economics has dealt with it before. Of course a study applying that concept to both public and private media companies and comparing the results would be great.</p>

    <p>Hello Phil,</p>
<p>I don't think you can compare a government with a charitable non-profit. After all it's one of the government prerogatives (also one of its defining characteristics) to hold vasts amounts of power and to be the unique ultimate judge in a given geographical region. I'm also highly suspicious of public opinion. I could quote Kierkegaard and also Ibsen on the dangers of public opinion, but this is an economics course not a philosophy course :)</p>
<p>Abolishing slavery wasn't an governmental idea, it was first advanced by private institutions and individuals. Could WWII have been avoided if the winners of WWI had been more considerate of Germany and not trying to humiliate a nation? I think that if we dig deep into history we can see that, as Nietzsche said:</p>
<p>"Madness is rare in individuals, but in groups, parties, nations and ages it is the rule."</p>

    <p>Besides libertarian paternalism think of all the propaganda, brainwashing, etc. that comes from governments, media, corporations...basically anyone in power who wants you to do what they want. There are many ways to manipulate. I think one of Thaler's points is that these things should be done for good, but it's true they can also be done for bad which he doesn't really address. </p>
<p>Governments are 1. run by people who have biases, and 2. voted in by people who have biases. Even today we have quite a lot of government sanctioned discrimination in this country against gay people.</p>

    <p>&gt; Thanks for the response Antonio. Like you said, this is an economics<br />
&gt; course not a philosophy course, but I always find that things come<br />
&gt; back to political philosophy one way or another.</p>
<p>I agree. Everything boils down to philosophy and morality is always<br />
inescapably in the background. Since as humans we are always judging<br />
things and judging is grounded in a moral evaluation. </p>
<p>&gt; Governments aren't charities, of course, but the greater power of<br />
&gt; most governments gives them the ability to do much more harm, but<br />
&gt; also much more good, than most charities. You could say the same<br />
&gt; thing about some large corporations, which also have more power than<br />
&gt; some governments, and can use that power for either good or bad<br />
&gt; purposes. It doesn't matter who came up with the idea of abolishing<br />
&gt; slavery. The point is that every government had to decide whether to<br />
&gt; accept or resist that idea. Most governments took a long time to<br />
&gt; accept abolition, but when they finally did, surely it was a good<br />
&gt; thing?</p>
<p>Yes it's true. But governments are practical institutions in the sense<br />
that going against an idea whose time has come is not conducent to its<br />
popularity and ultimately to its long time survival as an accepted<br />
institution. Remember that governments exits because the people accept<br />
them. Not because of any metaphysical consideration about the<br />
necessity of government. Also we could evaluate this decision not only<br />
has accepting something which is morally "right", as the abolition of<br />
slavery, but also has a way to coerce all those in favour of slavery<br />
in obeying the government. There's no way around it each decision made<br />
by someone in power always goes in the sense of increasing that<br />
power. Even if its grounded in the respect of the most elementary<br />
individual rights. Like the right of each individual to own<br />
himself/herself, which slavery denied to a lot of humans.</p>
<p>In a nutshell: I heartily agree that abolishing slavery was a good<br />
move by the government, but I cannot cast the government in a morally<br />
good light because of it. Yes I'm sure that many individuals in the<br />
government were for it, but it always ensues that through the new<br />
power to make slave trade illegal the government gained more power.<br />
And by the law of unintended consequences that increase in power could<br />
be used for doing things that are not so morally good in an obvious<br />
way.</p>
<p>&gt; In relation to World War II, even if you trace the origins of the<br />
&gt; crisis back to World War I, every country had to decide whether to<br />
&gt; appease the Nazis (or 2even ally with them), adopt an isolationist<br />
&gt; policy, support their allies who were threatened with invasion,<br />
&gt; declare war themselves, and so on. National self-interest plays a<br />
&gt; fundamental role in these choices, of course, but are you saying<br />
&gt; that there can never be any moral difference between a Government<br />
&gt; that supports the Nazis and one who opposes them?</p>
<p>I happen to place it in an ideological framework a not a moral<br />
one. There's also the question of survival and fighting the<br />
invasion. My WWII history is shaky but if I recall correctly, Hitler's<br />
first invasions and annexations were accepted by most European<br />
governments. They tried to appease him first. And that falls under the<br />
idea that wars are highly unpopular, unless they are of self-defense,<br />
therefore going to war is something that governments avoid, since it<br />
undermines its acceptance by the people and concomitantly its survival<br />
as an institution.</p>
<p>&gt; If 'madness' is the rule in 'groups, parties, nations and ages' does<br />
&gt; that mean that the governments led by Roosevelt and Churchill are<br />
&gt; just as mad as governments led by Stalin and Hitler? You want to<br />
&gt; avoid making moral judgments about governments, but I think it's<br />
&gt; unavoidable.</p>
<p>I agree. There's no way around moral evaluations of things. It's as<br />
natural as breathing. But even if Churchill and Roosevelt differ in<br />
very many respects of Stalin and Hitler, the institution that they<br />
lead has the same violence monopoly. In fact as a proof of that see<br />
how easy it was for democratic governments to become brutal police<br />
states. There's an ontological question that government, due to its<br />
very nature, cannot be "good".     </p>
<p>&gt; I'm very happy to be suspicious about the motives of governments, or<br />
&gt; the unintended consequences of their actions, but governments can<br />
&gt; sometimes do good things (as well as very bad things). And coming<br />
&gt; back to the ideas of 'libertarian paternalism', the question is<br />
&gt; whether the real risks of misguided government actions can be<br />
&gt; reduced if their main tool is persuasion rather than coercion.</p>
<p>You cannot base a functioning government, the way we conceive of it,<br />
solely on persuasion. For example, I demand that the government let me<br />
allocate the money I pay in taxes as I see fit. It's my money, why<br />
should it's use be decided by bureaucrats?  If I refuse to pay unless<br />
my wish is granted, I will be coerced in to paying no matter what. I<br />
can try to persuade the government for giving me the said allocation<br />
power, but since I cannot coerce the government in doing it, it's<br />
inefficient. There's an intrinsic asymmetry in every power relation.</p>
<p>My issue with the concept with the concept of libertarian paternalism<br />
is that ultimately it can be used as a way to cloak coercion as<br />
persuasion. And in the specific case of a monopolistic institution as<br />
the government the margin for such is very large.</p>
<p>&gt; I'm enjoying this discussion, and I hope it's not too far off<br />
&gt; topic. Best wishes.</p>
<p>Me too. Let's keep the fire burning.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the fascinating response Antonio</p>
<p>I agree with you that all government (and all law) depends ultimately upon a threat (implicit or explicit) of coercion. But some governments use coercion for very different purposes than others. In my way of thinking, some uses of government power are good (preventing unchecked violence, feeding the hungry, educating children, for example), and the use of coercion to achieve these ends may be justifiable if other methods are ineffective. That's what I meant by saying that 'persuasion' should be the 'main tool' of government. If government is trying to achieve some legitimate objective, then it should first try to persuade people to comply voluntarily. If it cannot persuade, then it has to decide whether the objective is so important, that coercion can be justified.</p>
<p>I agree with you that the danger of BE is that it may provide a way for coercion to be disguised as persuasion. But for me, we still have to ask whether it is being used for good or bad purposes. If the objectives are good, then I'd prefer to see them achieved by persuasion. If they cannot be achieved by persuasion, then sometimes the objective should be sacrificed because the objective is not sufficiently important to justify coercion. Government action to tackle obesity is justifiable, but if people cannot be persuaded to eat more healthily, compulsory measures would not be justified. On the other hand, most people don't need to be persuaded not to steal most of the time, but (as in Ariely's experiments) most of us cheat a little some of the time. We could arrange things to reduce the likelihood of cheating, but I think some coercion is justifiable to stop people stealing or trying to achieve an unfair advantage over others. </p>
<p>In these examples, government is trying to pursue a legitimate objective, but I agree with you that the danger is that when government is using 'persuasive' techniques, it may be harder to know what the objective is, and to debate whether it is justifiable. Government through law may be more 'coercive' but may also be more transparent and accountable. Government through 'persuasion' may be less coercive, but also less transparent, and harder to control.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if your position is that government, by its very nature, cannot be 'good', what is the evaluative word which you would prefer to use? If a government cannot be 'good' presumably it cannot be 'bad' either? A government may be 'efficient' or 'inefficient', but these words could apply to governments which are trying to achieve either good or bad purposes. (I'd prefer a good government to a bad one, but if I'm stuck with a bad one, I'd prefer it to be inefficiently bad.) Some people argue that 'big' government is always a greater danger to individuals than 'small' government, but I'm not convinced that's necessarily true, or that every increase in government power necessarily takes us a step closer to totalitarianism. We need to develop ways to make government accountable for its actions (which often means using one part of government to review the actions of another part), rather than just trying to limit the size of government.  Whether BE makes it easier or harder to achieve accountability is a fascinating question.</p>
