  <div class="content">
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Andrea LaGrow. I will celebrate 10 years of marriage to my Prince Charming in February. We have two furry children - miniature schnauzures - Conner and Caeser. We live in Rincon, GA, which is about 15 miles north of Savannah.</p>
<p>I have a BA in psychology, and when I had a "real" job, I worked in accounting. For the last three years, I have been learning Internet Marketing from research on my own. I have also been learning a bit of web design as well. I have a photography business, which I started last year, and I have tweaked the templates, as well as performing all of the SEO myself. You can take a peak at the site at <a href="http://digitalmediamemories.com" title="http://digitalmediamemories.com" rel="nofollow">http://digitalmediamemories.com</a>.</p>
<p>I recently completed Hubspot's Inbound Marketing University Certification Training and on Monday received confirmation that I had passed the exam. Hubspot's program is used in many universities for internet marketing training. I am very pleased with this result! However, just because I am certified doesn't mean I know everything - far from it. I am of the opinion that we need to continue learning and I LOVE to learn. I am here to continue learning how to market effectively.</p>
<p>My focus for this course is two fold: first and foremost, I would like to focus on my photography business (located at <a href="http://digitalmediamemories.com" title="http://digitalmediamemories.com" rel="nofollow">http://digitalmediamemories.com</a>). It seems like I can do great at the SEO and social media aspect, but I am terrible at offline marketing and I need to learn how to incorporate this aspect into my business. Second, I am planning to open my business, ABL2C, offering my SEO, social media assistance and web design to businesses. I would love any input my classmates have for this venture, as I have not done anything to launch it yet (it's still in the planning stages).</p>
<p>Thanks for the opportunity to be in this class and I look forward to working with everyone!</p>

    <p>Hi Andrea!I was wondering what resources you have been using for learning web design. Did you take a class or teach yourself? I have been dabbling in html/code writing but would like to do more intricate things and eventually build my own website. I look forward to working with you!<br />

    <p>Hmmm. how to answer this question? <a href="http://DigitalMediaMemories.com" title="http://DigitalMediaMemories.com" rel="nofollow">http://DigitalMediaMemories.com</a> is not the first website I have put up/designed. I have done two others - <a href="http://themoneypile.com" title="http://themoneypile.com" rel="nofollow">http://themoneypile.com</a> and <a href="http://andrealagrow.com" title="http://andrealagrow.com" rel="nofollow">http://andrealagrow.com</a> - but unless you go to the WaybackMachine, you won't see them, because I pulled them off of the web. I am proud to say that I did achieve a Pagerank of 4 on The MoneyPile though, and I did it in less than 6 months.</p>
<p>When I first got into trying web design, I tried building static websites, rather than blog pages that look like websites. However, the program I was using (and I can't remember the name right now) was definitely not intuitive, it was not WSYWYG, and it was not HTML or anything like that, so I looked elsewhere. I found a program called Internet Marketing University, and it walked me through the steps of not only installing a Wordpress blog onto my domain, but also which plugins to use and how to do do SEO and social media marketing. I discovered I was great at the mechanics of everything, but I had not picked a niche that I was passionate about, so after about 6 months I lost interest in posting to my blog.</p>
<p>I found a fantastic place to purchase blogging templates - <a href="http://studiopress.com" title="http://studiopress.com" rel="nofollow">http://studiopress.com</a> and if you purchase the top package, then you receive access to all of the templates for life, plus support. I found someone who was very helpful in pointing me in the right direction when I broke my templates (I liked switching them out several times). I found out that the best way to learn how to change things was to jump in and change some of the coding myself and see what happened. Now, that comes with a caveat - I searched online and learned a little HTML and W3 school and other places and also watched some videos on Youtube. You would be very surprised to learn how much free information there is on the internet to show you how to code. However, the very best way to learn is to not be afraid and jump in and try things for yourself. I always made sure I had a fresh copy of the files, in case I needed to delete and start over. But, I'm still learning.</p>
<p>I hope I was able to answer some of your questions. If you have any more questions - please ask. Oh - one other thing - if you are wanting to build websites - be sure to stay away from flash as your introductory page. Although Google is getting better at seeing it, it still takes forever to load, and Google will dock you for that for SEO, and some people will leave for site if it takes too long to load. I don't use flash at all. And, if you have been to my site, you will see that I don't have all that many images on my site as well. Those images on the front are the only ones that are actually sitting on the server. All other images are on another server that I use as the actual e-commerce portion of my site. It helps with the bandwidth. </p>
<p>Ok - enough for now - :)</p>

    <p>Thanks for the suggestion... It has been on my list to do now - for over a year! It just hasn't been a high priority for me. I have been overhauling the site for the past several weeks and I always mean to get to that... I also want to replace the copyright information that sits in the footer, but the coding on this site is too complicated for me right now. The last two templates I used were much easier for me to figure out. I must admit that that is also why I haven't created a favicon either. I haven't bothered to learn how to do and I refuse to pay someone else to do it for me. :)</p>

    <p>Hey everyone! I'm excited to be taking this course. I run a graphic design firm called Epic Life Creative. <a href="http://Www.EpicLifeCreative.com" title="Www.EpicLifeCreative.com" rel="nofollow">Www.EpicLifeCreative.com</a>  for over 6 years now we have been serving the Nashville , tn area and reaching out across the states and as far as Nepal, Africa, and Israel. </p>
<p>It's been an amazing ride and very humbling. I seek to serve others with design and marketing, helping them to take their dream to a reality. Our specialty is helping people begin their first steps as a new business.</p>
<p>My focus this course will be learning new areas  of marketing. 99% of what I do is self taugh and intuitive, so I deeply desire to learn strategies and effective common practices.</p>
<p>There are multiple things I should know that I have no clue about, such as seo and search engine optimization. </p>
<p>I hope to bring encouragement and imagination to the table. By nature I am a futuristic idiator, so this class will help add a solid foundation to what we already have in place at Epic Life Creative.</p>

    <p>Hey everyone. My name is Patrick and I have an MBA in Marketing Analytics / Brand Management. I have built several websites over the years and have been working very hard to get the right mix of social media, SEO, and some PPC for HuddleHub. </p>
<p>My goal for this class is to learn about cost effective means to reaching new customers and being able to convert them. I have extensive background with Google analytics, AB split testing, SEO, and other marketing techniques if needed.</p>
<p>I would like to do some competitive research on PPC campaigns for companies in a certain vertical/industry. I think it would be interesting to determine why companies have chosen those keywords, why they pay what they do, and maybe try to find some corrolation between cost, frequency, and market capatilization.</p>

    <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>Nice website, but I was curious how the Cowboys are doing in the playoffs this year?  I am a fantasy player as well, MLB, NFL, NBA and college hoops.  I just had to be first with the trash talk after reading about love for the trash talk...lol.  Have a great night.</p>

    <p>Awesome! HuddleHub will definitely have an awesome fantasy baseball app (possibly an awesome March Madness app) out this year!</p>
<p>I do love me some trash talk, but I can't defend my Cowboys this year :(. They were just downright awful. They need a lot of work on the defensive side of the ball and a good RB.</p>
<p>What teams do you follow?</p>

    <p>MLB - Red Sox &amp; Twins.  NFL - Patriots, Vikings, Jaguars.  NBA - Celtics.  Now the three NFL teams are aligned with where I have resided over the years.  19 years in MN, where I grew up.  College in Boston and worked for the Red Sox (I am die-hard) and now reside in Jacksonville...so the Jaguars.</p>
<p>I agree they have some work, but I liked the coaching change 100% and believe the Cowboys will tough in a year or two.</p>

    <p>You are very smart to market your business on the internet. One of the case studies we had at HubSpot was a dentist who was having difficulty building up her clientele. She has the bright idea to launch her own blogging website. In order to get more subscriptions and build up her list, she offered an ebook that she wrote herself. The title of the ebook was something about "Your Dental Health and Sex." I'm not sure how it was all tied together, but that title alone was catchy enough for people to be curious enough to be added to her list and her business went through the roof!</p>

    <p>Hello! My name is Indira Cornelio I live in Mexico. I coordinate the Communication and Public Relations Department of REDDES (NGO that works in projects of open software, technology, education and sustainable development) I'm here to learn more about e-marketing and how to take the best of the digital tools for the following reasons: this year we started offering workshop for rights advocates in Mexico, Nicaragua, Chile, Bolivia and Peru so they can use this tools in order to apply them into their advocacy labors and so they can communicate their messages, we also finished planning a course of environmental education for people with a very specific profile and we are searching for the best ways to get this specific audience into the course; all the information of the course has been written and design for them, but how to get in touch with them, I already have a bunch of ideas but I know this course will help me on this. Also in promoting the courses in Latinamerica I tried to use some of the social networks but the think that worked the best for us was the direct mail. So I'll really love to learn more about how to deliver those messages to the audiences you need to communicate with.</p>
<p>I'm in charge of the facebook page of Reddes (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/contactoreddes" title="http://www.facebook.com/contactoreddes" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/contactoreddes</a>), the twitter account (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/contactoreddes" title="http://www.twitter.com/contactoreddes" rel="nofollow">http://www.twitter.com/contactoreddes</a>) I'm also the administrator of the site (<a href="http://www.reddes.org" title="www.reddes.org" rel="nofollow">www.reddes.org</a>) that is on Joomla. I'm 23 and I finished the college on march 2010 and I started to work on january 2010 and I really love working on teaching rights advocates to use these new platforms that will help them do their work better. I also know that I must learn about some other tools and specially about the strategic use of the online tools in order to get results offline. </p>
<p>I would like to share with you the link of the project we have being working last year <a href="http://www.informationactivism.org/en" title="www.informationactivism.org/en" rel="nofollow">www.informationactivism.org/en</a> this is a project of Tactical Technology Collective that we have being promoting in Lationamerica. And it shows 10 tactics that advocates can use to communicate their causes.</p>
<p>I know I'll learn so much here and I will definitely share with you everything that I find helpful!</p>
<p>Have a nice day/night :)</p>

    <p>Indira,</p>
<p>I praise your commitment to making a difference. In our current society inequality goes beyond economic means and social development as the most disadvantaged are now facing being left behind by the digital online revolution. Yet the Internet offers a great way to leverage inequalities and inconsistencies across society if you can help and share the knowledge. As applications and tools become available online, those that can access the internet only need training to leverage these tools to their advantage and empower their causes. </p>
<p>In my consulting I specialize in finding and providing cloud technologies, utilities and sites to customize solutions for organizations. I am a big fan of Google Apps and Docs with their set of tools that can provide anyone with an Internet connection a fantastic way to start a business and save thousands in hardware, software and licensing costs.  </p>
<p>I had an opportunity to check the websites in your posting and their creativity and art work is great... I look foward to your contributions and ideas. </p>
<p>Saludos cordiales,</p>

    <p>Greetings to everyone. I am a former k12 teacher and technology director for a school district in the Seattle area. Just over a year ago I left the district to try my hand as an independent technology consultant. I specialize in open source software, teacher professional development (technology integration) and eLearning. I am a musician having taught high school band for many years and played in the Bremerton Symphony for a number of years. I have built numerous very complex web sites using a variety of open source tools and even wrote a number of PHP/MYSQL web applications for my previous employer. My goal in taking this course is to learn more about marketing my one person company both online and in more traditional ways. I look forward to getting to know everybody.</p>

    <p>Greetings all. Excited to learn with a community - been doing it solo for a while. I'm the administrator of 3 websites (and still just learning my chops), and am here to learn the e-marketing side, to move fully into entrepreneurship (something I planned on doing when I was young but wasn't ready for, till now at age 51!) Sites: stillmountainretreatguide.com and integralrecovery.com and profoundmeditationprogram.com<br />
My background is as a psychotherapist working with at risk youth and young adults, dealing with addiction, launching issues, learning issues, depression, anxiety, etc. My particular passion is for transpersonal/spiritual transformation, hence the retreat directory website. I want to learn and implement marketing plans for these three sites, learn and implement SEO and traffic generation, and learn a system for developing marketing strategy.

    <p>Hi All,<br />
My name is Karen and I live on the NSW Mid North Coast of Australia.<br />
I am passionate about supporting people to improve, eating, exercise and using positive psychology strategies to improve their health and wellbeing and for disease prevention. I have written a coaching program to support coaches to deliver coaching to groups, gyms or organisations about ways to live a happy healthy life.<br />
I have a person currently assisting me with my website <a href="http://www.karenplumbecoaching.com" title="www.karenplumbecoaching.com" rel="nofollow">www.karenplumbecoaching.com</a> however, I would like to learn more about SEO, google, and develop a marketing strategy. I have already created a blog and I have a facebook page but my challenge is getting them to all work together and to get the word out.<br />
Sounds like there is a knowledgeable group as part of this course and I look forward to learning together with you all.</p>

    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I'm 26, I'm from Colombia and currently reside in Bogotá were I work in IT for a large company. I don't have any academic background on marketing but I have been reading online and experimenting on my own. I am an Electronics engineer and I am self taught on graphic design (mostly web).</p>
<p>On my free time I run a side-project (I dont think you can call it a start-up after 2 years) with a couple of friends. It's an online tshirt store you can check it out at <a href="http://artifacts.co" title="http://artifacts.co" rel="nofollow">http://artifacts.co</a>. So far we are in the "Informed optimisim" stage and it has been running ok with the time we have invested.<br />
What I want from this course is to learn as much as possible about e-marketing to be able to take the right decisions and don't waist time/money.</p>
<p>To the class I can contribute my experiences in this journey, things that just don't work and things that have worked for me.</p>
<p>Selling on internet has been a challenge, especially in my Country (should I say Latin-America overall?) and I hope that this course will allow me to have tools to make it easier.</p>
<p>Looking forward to share some knowledge here with you guys!</p>

    <p>Greetings all! I'm Karen, the class "organiser" (remember we're all teachers and learners here).</p>
<p>I have done marketing for several small start-ups, both my own and others, in areas as diverse as tech, farming, construction, and food politics. My strengths are probably in marketing strategy, messaging, marketing (and business) plan development, and content. I have a fair amount of experience in social media, but less in online advertising so I'll be looking forward to learning from you all on that. </p>
<p>Personally, I live off the grid in a house I built myself in the middle of nowhere (after many years in a big city). I love it here.</p>
<p>I have several projects I am currently marketing, but the one I want to focus on during this course is open content, in particular an open dictionary I'm helping build (<a href="http://dictionary.k12opened.com" title="http://dictionary.k12opened.com" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.k12opened.com</a>). It is an interesting challenge to market something that doesn't have to be "bought" just believed in and used (like P2PU). I am passionate about open education because I think it can be a better way to learn.</p>
<p>My learning goals for this class:</p>
<p>- to develop strategies to get more users (builders and end users) for the Open Dictionary, especially through better messaging and communication<br />
- to learn more about the pros and cons of various online ad campaigns (FB, Google AdWords, etc.) especially through the real life experiences of you all<br />
- to explore new models of “open learning” beyond just Open Educational Resources (OER)<br />
- to build my experience w/online facilitation and hone in on what works and what doesn't</p>
<p>I am really looking looking forward to it!</p>

    <p>Hey everyone, great to join such a talented pool of people. </p>
<p>My experience covers a range from: mobile phone development and distribution (domestic / international), music production, sound FX production, live radio broadcast, graphic design, web-site construction, social media management, SEO, silk screening and event production. </p>
<p>The reason I am here is a cross between each of these experiences. In addition to ongoing freelance and volunteer work, I have also co-founded a music and art workshop series in East Los Angeles targeted towards youth. The goal of the workshop is to enable young people to develop their talents, and give them the technological tools to share their work and generate income from it online. </p>
<p>Specifically from this class I want to learn marketing techniques to share the content created from the workshops to an international audience of art and music lovers. </p>
<p>My experience is pretty broad, while working for a top international entertainment company in los angeles by day, i am also connected diversely throughout california to independent artists and business's. if there is anything i can assist any of you with please don't hesitate to contact. </p>
<p>I hope that throughout the class I will have working examples of promotional materials, websites, and content presentations to share with you and would love feedback, critiques and opinions as often as possible! </p>

    <p>Hi Aaron. It's great to find another music lover in this class. Mixing vinyl and producing beats is a passion of mine as well. What genre do you produce?  My style is house music (deep, soulful, tech). That's awesome that you're helping underprivileged youth discover their passions. Must respect bro!</p>

    <p>Hi Aaron, I have great admiration for those who work with youth. I spent many years influencing youth via my former career as a high school music teacher. Nothing more satisfying to me than seeing the impact that music and art can have on a young persons life. Given the current available technology it is awesome what any student can do with a computer and a bit of software. Good luck in your efforts.</p>

    <p>Hi Javier!! Pues encantada de conocerte!! ;-)<br />
I read in your presentations that you had lived in Spain!! I've never been to Canary Islands!! It's a pity because I've heard that they are awsome! I hope one day I can go!!<br />
Yes, I studied sound and image! but I work in a television and I don't work with sound... I do specific works...I use to work in the 24 hour news channel. There we have a virtual set, I don't know if you are interested in it... We work with an Orad system for the virtual set and a Radamec system for the cameras... If you are interested in it I can explain you more or send you information. We don't still work with HD cameras... I also give technical support to the journalists in the studio.<br />
I also work sometimes in the broadcast studio (I don't know exactly the name in English). I am the responsible of the emission controling the signal quality and controling all day programs... If you need some specific information don't hesitate and ask it to me!! I will try to help you!! I don't have a lot of experience in sound but I can look it up for you in my workplace! </p>
<p>Please to meet you Javier!!</p>

    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I used to be a Java engineer, PM and have always been into photography.  I have some experience with some of the things mentioned above, web dev, SEO, Social Media....but I need more knowledge.  What I want to get out of this class are some bootstrapped marketing strategies to get the most out of the effort for the lowest overall cost...both monetarily and effort wise. </p>
<p>I want to use my photoblog as the experiment in taking a mediocre product and pushing the limits of what sort of following and interaction i get.  I know this will also require me to focus the intent of the blog more but down what path, I hope to discover as I see what strategies are feasible from a limited budget.  In my opinion...learning how to make something from nothing is a better overall lesson than coming from somewhere where my resources and budget is vast.</p>
<p>my blog is <a href="http://lifeisstill.com" title="http://lifeisstill.com" rel="nofollow">http://lifeisstill.com</a></p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you all and learning.</p>

    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I'm Ryan.  I'm one of the few people here who is still a full time student!  I'm doing a masters degree at the School of Information Studies at McGill University in Montreal Canada, focused open access to education and information.... so I am as excited about the process of this P2PU course as I am about the content.  </p>
<p>I'm working on two entrepreneurial projects that I hope to kick into full gear as soon as I finish my studies this spring.  The first is a simple boardgames company I am working on with a friend.  We have made dozens of great games over the years, and now we're ready to polish them up and bring them to market!  Hopefully this project is a perfect size to get my feet wet in the world of e-commerce.  </p>
<p>The second project is a social enterprise I am developing with two friends studying economics and computing at Oxford.  We are developing a platform to support microfinance institutions and microfinanced entrepreneurs sell their products internationally.  The project will require that someone (me) learns everything there is to know about marketing on the internet.  And so here I am, keen to learn, and hopefully with a thing or two to contribute!  </p>
<p>This will be my first foray into the world of marketing (though I hope my undergraduate degree in psychology gives me a firm starting point).  It is fantastic to see the range of experience in the course.  I'm looking forward to working with you all!</p>

    <p>Hello! What a great group of people in this class, I so look forward to learning and getting to know you.</p>
<p>As for me, I'm Jane Saylor, a Spirit and Soul Life Coach from a small community in southeast Michigan, USA. I have been working, researching, and learning in the self help field for most of my life (I'm almost 50 now... so its been a while!) My work addresses the subconscious mind, overcoming negative habits and changing the way we think and feel, and also communication and relationships. My website is <a href="http://www.ThePowerofSelfHelp.com" title="www.ThePowerofSelfHelp.com" rel="nofollow">www.ThePowerofSelfHelp.com</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last 2 years I've researched, designed and developed an individual assessment process which has allowed clients to recognize what they need to do get life back on track. It's all falling right into place, the synchronicity of life amazes me. </p>
<p>I am in this class to learn more about marketing in a variety of areas (and also because I consider myself a 'stalker of knowledge'... I just want to know!)</p>
<p>My website was developed thru SiteBuildIt. I really enjoyed the process of doing it all myself. Thru the years I have taught myself how to design professional looking brochures, books, and much more.</p>
<p>I have one book which I published in 2006 called The Road You've Traveled, which teaches people to journal their life. The assessment program I spoke of earlier will be broken down into a series of books which will called the Combat Stress and Chaos Series. </p>
<p>About 10 years ago I used to layout and publish poetry books for people in the community using Adobe Pagemaker which I learned on what I like to call, a need to know basis... when I needed to know it, I'd learn it! (:</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing what I know and learning from all of you,</p>
<p>Smiles to you,<br />
Jane</p>

    <p>Your assessment tool sounds like a great idea -- sometimes people feel stuck and don't know why. I'll be interested in how you end up promoting your site, because I'm also planning to promote written information online. Not too different.</p>

    <p>Hi Jane,<br />
Looking forward to connecting with you more. Congratulations on publishing the book, how did you go about that? I am a health coach based in Australia, I have written a health coaching program for other coaches to deliver so have joined the class to learn how to spread the word.<br />
All the best<br />

<p>I published my book in 2006 through an on-demand publisher, Author House. Back when I began the process of publishing in 2003 or 2004 there weren't many options as there are today. My next books will be published differently though. (:</p>

    <p>My name is Clarence Cromwell. I'm a writer and journalist, but right now my day job is in house painting.</p>
<p>I tried to start up an alternative paper in 2009, after my local paper announced it would close down and start a web-based newspaper. I didn't have much luck selling ads, so the paper didn't last long. I decided several things: to publish on the web in the future, to not rely on local business advertising to fund an edgy and irreverent publication, and to be better at marketing next time.</p>
<p> What I'd like to do next is create an online publication with the kind of writing I do best, which is more like a magazine article than like a typical newspaper item.</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to describe the new publication to readers or potential donors (who would pay the costs of keeping it online) without being boring or turning them away in droves. I'd like to make sure I'm reaching the right people (not people who don't want to read or fund my work). I'd also like to learn the best kinds of media to reach people with this project. I have a strong hunch I'll be using Facebook, Twitter and Constant Contact, but I'm willing to try anything that might work. </p>
<p>I've spent some time talking to business people about how they're advertising online and offline, what's working for them and what isn't, so I might have something useful to offer for discussion on those points.  </p>
<p>Some things I wouldn't mind collaborating on would be research into how to use social media advertising to promote a business; specifically, I'd like to work out really practical tactics, as specific as "when you have a sale, make a facebook post with a picture and a message including the word SALE." Stuff I can act on and that I know will work for me.</p>

    <p>Hi Clarence,</p>
<p>We do indeed have much in common. From 1999 to 2001 I was publishing a small local paper in my community which contained a bunch of fun information, from what was going on around town to book, movie, and restaurant reviews, and then some poetry and short stories. Unfortunately, after 9/11 though the advertisers dropped and so the paper did too.</p>
<p>I look forward to getting to know about you and your work.</p>

    <p>Hi all! I'm Sam from upstate NY. I currently work with a very cool start up company called Ecovative. We are developing and producing radically sustainable alternatives to Styrofoam and other synthetic plastic materials. We're growing these alternative materials using... mushroom technology! </p>
<p>Although my background is in mechanical engineering and product design, I wear many hats at this start up, and one of those hats is marketing. My father is a marketing exec, so growing up I was always giving feedback on new product names, commercial concepts, etc. I write all the content for our website, blog, twitter and facebook. Please check it out and tell me what you think! </p>

<p>My goals are to learn new ways to more effectively spread the word about the benefits of our new materials with as little time and money as possible. I think with my design background I can contribute a lot of design critique and suggestions for this class. </p>
<p>Looking forward to learning!<br />

    <p>Hi Julie - beautiful, beautiful photos! One question though - who is your target market? You have pictures of everything on your front page.</p>

    <p>The question of "who is your target market?" has occurred to me reading several of these posts. Knowing who you are trying to reach is an important prerequisite for marketing all of our enterprises. It affects all the other strategic and tactical decisions (pricing, advertising, social media, how you distribute, etc.)</p>
<p>Sometimes we may be surprised that our enterprise has markets that we didn't even think of originally, but having a starting point is a good place to begin.</p>
<p>As one example, everyone is very excited about social media right now, but only a small percentage of folks are on Twitter (and fewer yet actively participate in it...although those who do tend to be early adopters). It is worth thinking about where your target customers are (geographically, offline vs. online, where online, etc.) and spending your time/$ proportionally.</p>

    <p>I only asked it of Julie because I had just got into this business last year and I had someone who has been in the business for over 10 years look at my photos (I had asked for a critique). The first thing she said to me was "Beautiful images." The second thing she asked me was "Who is your target market? Your photos are all over the map." </p>
<p>Point well taken. That was an aha as well as a duh moment. I was looking at my site from my point of view and not the point of view from the consumer. I went to college - I've taken courses in marketing since then - I should know this by now - right?  WRONG! It's very difficult to put yourself in the shoes of the customer until you are the customer. I had photos three different types of photography on my site, but no children's photos and I was billing myself as a children's photography!!</p>
<p>Skip ahead to a lot of lessons learned since then (retail shop opened and closed)and I see her point. I've changed the focus of my site and having to redo the SEO as well. </p>
<p>And I'm still not 100% sure WHO I'm targeting - the teens, the parents, or both?</p>

    <p>I do a variety of work - hence why the landing page shows this.  I do not specialize in babies.  That I know. I leave that to the baby photographers.  I sell alot of my work as prints, as well as commerical work and I do families and children.  The nature shots you see are usually my shots when I actually get to shoot for myself.</p>
<p>I haven't had an issue of defining who my target market is - although its people, whether I take them for personal reasons, business reasons or for them to hang on their wall...so I guess I do have a target market.  I didn't want to get into a "niche" market...and found those who have booked me for personal reasons love my "eye"....and see that I am capable of many things.<br />
I do have photographer friends who do target specifically to family.  although I have one who targets family, but you will commercial work on her site as well as stuff just for her.  So I am not sure you can pigeon-hole yourself or you may not be able to expand....I don't know what the right answer is, I just know it is working for me.<br />

    <p>On that particular site, yes, that I all I target. High school students, and seniors in particular, are my target market. </p>
<p>It is difficult to be broad with your meta title, meta description and meta keywords, not to mention optimizing for the targeted two to three keywords you really want to rank high for in Google. I use my website, and optimize it for those certain things so that I can try to get onto at least the first page of Google, ideally above the fold for my two to three targeted keywords.</p>

    <p>Hello,<br />
My name is Scott, I live Las Vegas NV. I sell computer technology and Cloud computing solutions. I don't have a marketing background, I have been in sales for 15 years. I am interested using on-line marketing to bring in more business and hopefully have customers start calling me to compliment my prospecting. I hope to learn the best way to get my advertisements out to the most targeted potential buyers.</p>
<p>thanks!<br />

    <p>Hello,<br />
my name is johannes.<br />
I am from Germany, but I've been living in Australia for 7 years now. My wife is from the US, Seattle.<br />
We both work for a non profit organisation called YWAM.<br />

<p>YWAM (pronounced: why-wham) is a non-denominational Christian youth organisation operating in many diverse cultures and nations around the world. We are committed to training and facilitating community projects and programs that meet the practical, spiritual and physical needs of people in the communities we serve. (this is from our website and I couldn't say it much better. what it means though is that we are helping people in Papua New Guinea. Check out our website if you wanna know more)</p>
<p>I am completely self taught as far as anything goes really.<br />
I am heading up our Online Marketing at the moment, using mainly FB, Google, and i am also dabbling a little bit in webdesign. personally i prefer WP and i am attempting to switch all our websites to WP as anyone can update them quite easily and it is hard to break it..<br />
(we have a lot of turn over at our org)</p>
<p>I hope to learn how to get the word out about our org and what we do. i think Google and FB work, but there must be heaps more. Plus we work on a tight budget...</p>
<p>great, I am looking forward learning with all of you guys.<br />
even though i feel a little out of place looking at all your background and websites...</p>

    <p>It is not a bad grant, but Google only lets you set a maximum PPC of $1, so if anyone else out there is bidding on the same keywords your chances are slim<br />
also you are not able to advertise on their network only on their searches, whcih also limits your exposure tremendeously</p>
<p>what that means though is, that you have to do a lot of research finding  "cheap" keywords and targeting niches<br />
which takes up a lot of time which most non profits don't have.</p>
<p>it definitely is a great grant, but it comes with a lot of work....</p>

    <p>Hello,<br />
I'm Angelica. I currently live in Raleigh, NC, and I'm originally from Sunrise, FL. I am a full-time student at UNC-Chapel Hill majoring in Spanish, and I work full-time in the Marketing &amp; Promotions Department at the Harley-Davidson dealership in Raleigh. </p>
<p>I started taking classes in public relations and marketing as electives, and found that I really enjoy this field. As part of my job (technically an internship) I work on promotions, event planning and new customer initiatives. I maintain the dealership website, three separate Facebook pages, a Twitter account, and am getting ready to re-launch our YouTube page. For the website, I mainly work with html code (mostly just moving things around, adding new images), but would really like to learn webdesign from the ground up. </p>
<p>I hope that I can bring a unique view to the course on marketing. Most of what I have experience in (and I don't have much!) is event and brand marketing. My single largest event I had a hand in was our annual Bikefest, which was attended by 85,000 people from the southeast! Most of our events average anywhere from 50-300 people. </p>
<p>My goals for this course are to learn as much as possible. I am always keeping my ears and eyes open in an attempt to learn something new, and I try to live by the "try anything once" motto, because you never know what hidden talents you may have for something. I am in the starting stages (okay, more like dreaming stage) for creating a website that will focus on healthy living on a budget. I hope that what I learn from this course and from you all will help me get closer to that dream. </p>
<p>I look forward to working with all of you!</p>

A site for women with cluttered closets to sell or rent out their clothes, shoes, accessories within a network of friends.  I have built this site myself (and no, I don't know code), so it's all a work in progress, and not anywhere close to where I want the site to be... but very exciting nonetheless!  My idea here is not to become a Craigslist or an eBay, but to be a niche place where friends can see what friends are getting rid of ("one mans trash is another mans treasure" same thing here, except targeted towards a wo-man ;)</p>
<p>My goals for this course would be how to leverage social media to market efficiently.  For Bin86, I would like to learn the most effective way to build a community.  I have my target market... now I need everything else.  All in all, I'm pretty open to learning anything and everything marketing-related, whether it be for Bin86 or the next new project I get into.</p>
<p>If I could contribute anything to this class it would be sharing my random knowledge.  I am a total nerd for "tech news" (I focus mainly on new and cool start ups; this is how I was able to build my Bin86 site for free).  Feel free to follow me on Twitter and see interesting news posts or awesome pictures I take with my iPhone.<br />

<p>The best to everyone and I look forward to learning and networking with everyone here.</p>

    <p>Not sure : )  I have never heard of that, so I am definitely looking it up now!  I have a lot to do for the business idea though.  First and foremost, I need someone who can code! Woo - hoo!  I've met a lot of people willing to work on this project, but I haven't met anyone that sees eye to eye with the vision of the business.  Once I get the site that I want up and running. . . I would LOVE a write up on Mashable!</p>

    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Janel and I live in Austin, TX. My hometown is St. Louis, MO. I've lived and worked in Chicago, Las Vegas and Los Angeles as well. My day job is in technical recruiting. On my downtime I produce music and DJ occasionally. I have 12 years experience in the music industry that has taken me to many parts of the world. My fiance' and I are at the beginning stages of creating an online music start-up, which is currently in stealth mode.</p>
<p>Currently, I work in the staffing organization at VMware, which is a large enterprise virtualization software company. My role includes many social media related activities. Working in high tech has been an enjoyable experience as it's continually evolving.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, my ultimate goal is to become a music entrepreneur, with my own digital record label. In order to achieve success, I must promote myself as a brand within the various social platforms online. I'd like to learn the best practices for marketing the content I produce through these respective channels.</p>
<p>Heading into this course, I plan to learn as much as I can from those that are more experienced than myself. One of the truly exciting aspects of this course is that the student population is a global demographic. One thing that I'd like to bring to the table is my experiences of marketing myself internationally as a DJ. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about my background and endeavors. I've enjoyed reading all of the introductions and mission statements. This appears to be a very talented and diverse group of driven individuals.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Janel</p>

    <p>Hi! My name is Ikem. I am an artist from Manchester, England. I am going to make a brilliant t-shirt design enterprise. Great art stays in the mind (we all remember that "Obama... Change" image, right?). I want to create wearable designs that are both pop and political but reflect our changing times. The breadth of this course appeals to me: time-honoured principles extending beyond the internet and search engine skulduggery.</p>
<p>This enterprise, factory-fresh, allows me to pull my many interests under the same canopy: design, computing, entrepreneurship. I am a magpie (really?) interested in a great many things. I love my marital arts and sing to myself in public places. Specifically, I want to learn much more about branding, and how to communicate a message that stays in the mind. I would definitely like some assistance from anybody who knows more about this than I do!</p>
<p>I can contribute my visual sense to the class - so if you have any images or a website design you're unsure of, I can help you get that right ( and I can code a little bit, too).</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Ashley.  I live in western Washington.  I got laid off last week, so any marketing work I was going to focus on that company is no longer.  I do, however, have about 20 different startup ideas floating around, so I’m taking this as a sign that I need to actually START with at least one of those ideas.  My hang up seems to be my attention span and interests: I tend to get bored with things quickly and I want to move on to learning about the next thing that sparks my interest, which is usually in a totally new area (i.e. I love horses, animals, cars, psychology, behavior, architecture, fashion, design, art, writing, painting, sustainable living, health, fitness, religion, dance, reading, food, cooking, racing, outdoor activities, photography, alternative energies, electric vehicles, inventing things, anything new, etc., etc., etc.).  My focus right now is figuring out how to do everything I love in a way that conforms to society’s rules and boundaries.  </p>
<p>For now my “enterprise” will be a health and wellness business.  Helping people feel great by developing physical, mental and emotional fitness.  I, like nearly everyone else, want to help people.  I want to help motivate people to stretch their comfort zones and go deeper to learn about themselves.  I want to show people they can be happy as they are now and teach them how they can change to get greater satisfaction with life.  I guess this boils down to being a life coach, but it could also be a business with multiple employees that focuses on different forms of movement and healthier eating while teaching people little things to help shift their perspective on life…so, pretty much a new-age gym :-).  I am passionate about this because our inner state of mind is reflected in the world; I am convinced that helping people find peace within themselves will eventually create peace around the world.  </p>
<p>I would love to learn how to market myself; I have some confidence issues around telling people “I am the person you need.”  I also hope to gain insight into how other people got their businesses off the ground.  I don’t have a lot of specific goals; I find that whatever I need to learn about myself or otherwise will be presented.  Just learning is my life goal.</p>
<p>I am good at editing copy and pictures; I think I have a good eye for composition and design.  I’m also good at developing simpler or more efficient ways of doing things.  </p>
<p>I really look forward to learning with you all!</p>

    <p>Hey Ashley,</p>
<p>I really liked your post.  You are definitely a creator.  You have a vision, and like many, you just don't know where to start.  You have enthusiasm though, and that is the number one thing to starting something and having people believe in you and your product : )</p>
<p>If I could give you advice on the one thing it seems like you're struggling with the most: "marketing yourself".  Start small.  Become everyone's "yes, man".  If someone has trouble with something, or someone needs something -- you be the one to do it for them.  Whether it's a big challenge, or something as small as getting a coffee for someone... people will start to see you as someone who can get it done.  You'll start to feel like you can "get it done".  And after a while, you'll start to realize how super awesome you are at marketing yourself.  It's SO easy!  You just need some confidence on top of all that enthusiasm : )</p>
<p>PS- if ever you're stuck with an issue/question you don't know.  Try not to say "I don't know".  And instead say "I'm not sure, but I can definitely find out".</p>

    <p>Hi, Ashley. Sounds like this might be the time to start one of your start-ups!</p>
<p>Marketing yourself is a big part of being an entrepreneur...or anything really. In fact, marketing yourself could be the focus for a whole course on P2PU :)...or the culminating project for this course. I recently put together a workshop on creating online portfolios (as an alternative to a resume) and found it to be a great exercise. </p>
<p>It sounds like you have a lot of talent and enthusiasm....and health/wellness is something much in demand right now.</p>

    <p>I think it would be an AWESOME workshop, if each of us did our own online portfolio!  I have read a lot of buzz about video resumes, and I think if each of us can market ourselves effectively -- we'll all be super stars!  I, of course, am saying this as someone who is extremely camera shy, and will immediately regret posting this if the group decides to follow through! Haha.</p>

    <p>Hey Ashley,<br />
I really like your idea of a "new-age gym". I am focusing on healthy living as my enterprise as well, though I'm not absolutely sure what exactly that will manifest into. I just know that I enjoy health and wellness topics, as well as helping others to learn to live a healthy lifestyle. It seems like you have a lot of great, creative ideas and I look forward to working with you during this class!</p>

    <p>Hi Ashley,<br />
Great post, sounds like we have somethings in common. Maybe we could work together, health and wellbeing is a strong area of interest of mine. I am a health coach and love the idea of supporting people to make sustainable change to their lifestyle.<br />
I like you struggle with the whole idea of marketing myself... working through that challenge every day.<br />
I look forward to learning with you also</p>

    <p>Hi Everybody! </p>
<p>My name is Chuck and I live in Seattle, WA. I work for a startup that makes applications and software for the small business accounting market. We are called CloudSway and I'm very pride to work with such a cool team. I run the marketing for our company. Which right now consists of Social Media, SEO, Tradeshows, and so on. I'm great with the online marketing world but I don't have the basic framework that many traditional marketers have.  When I'm not behind a computer I'm usually in the mountains hiking, skiing, snowboarding, and camping. Sometimes I feel like I have a split personality between the online and outdoor world ;) </p>
<p>I'd like to focus on my company for this course as I'm very passionate about and love to work on it. It's fun because we can actually solve problems that small businesses have. There's nothing worse than missing paperwork at tax time and our goal is to alleviate that pain and do it cheaply. </p>
<p>I specifically want to expand my marketing foundation. I feel like I've been "doing" marketing for years without knowing why or what it is. Essentially, I want to gain knowledge in the traditional elements of marketing that will enable me to put a method behind my madness. </p>
<p>I'd love to work with others on building an identity for companies. For some reason I've found myself good at finding the "voice" of a company. I will freely admit that I need help when it comes to the more traditional aspects of marketing. Anyone with that knowledge please feel free to shout it out! I want to make sure that the things I do on a day-to-day basis are rooted in good processes that are building something.</p>

    <p>Hi Cristina! </p>
<p>I usually ski in the Cascades in Washington and the Coastal Mountains in British Columbia. It's incredible to be around these mountains, I'm very lucky to live an hour away from skiing. Do you live in Spain? I have spent a little time in Barcelona but otherwise my time in Spain has been limited unfortunately. </p>

    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Im Lori Shaw, 27 years old and live in Brisbane, Australia.</p>
<p>I have recently been accepted to QUT University to study a Bachelor of Business major: Marketing.  It has always been my dream to open my own Hair and Beauty Wellness Centre that brings together and educates individuals of a community on how to take better care of themselves, their families and each other.</p>
<p>I am passionate about communities coming back together – it seems as though life is difficult enough without feeling like you have no support or no-one understands what you’re going through – I want to provide a place where people can come together and feel that love and support is available everyday right at their doorstep.</p>
<p>I have a desire to learn and teach – which is what I hope to add and gain from these classes, but the one thing I need help on is creating a strong mission statement and business outline so that I am not side-tracked when I finally open the business.  </p>
<p>My motto is to be more prepared that you think!</p>
<p>Thanks guys, I am really looking forward to this time we’ll have together</p>
<p>Love L</p>

    <p>Aloha,</p>
<p>My name is Tristan Cummins.  I am 28 and originally from Long Island New York, currently live in Honolulu Hawaii.  I have just discovered my passion for entrepreneurship and am excited about learning with everyone in this course.  Owning my own business is my dream and I feel fortunate for learning opportunities like this one.</p>
<p>I have several ideas bouncing around in my head but the one I will be focusing on for this course is an Ice Cream Truck business.  I see a need for this in Hawaii and would like to be the one to feed that need.  The idea is to modernize the standard truck (bio-diesel, possibly solar powered freezers) and deliver locally made frozen treats to the visitors and residents of Hawaii.  Like most kids where I grew up my sister and I would jump at the first sign of the local Ice Cream truck.  We would chase him for blocks if it meant a chance to choose our favorite treat off the giant menu.  I want this and future generations of kids to enjoy that same feeling in a more environmentally responsible way.  </p>
<p>I will offer sincere constructive feedback.  My experience in marketing is limited but I will do my best to offer constructive feedback.  I currently work in the hotel industry as an Aquatics Manager and in my previous life in NY I was a Real Estate Appraiser.</p>
<p>Mahalo,<br />
Tristan Cummins</p>
