    <p>Another company's mission statement: [Twitter] </p>
<p> “To instantly connect people everywhere to what’s most important to them.” </p>
<p>strengths: ambitious and sincere sounding goal that every one can appreciate.<br />
weaknesses: doesnt give any indication of how connection is achieved. </p>
<p>The mission statement provided for twitter is definitely short and memorable, it gives a sense of awe and wonder about how in any facet people may be enabled to connect everywhere over what is important to them. it does not however give a clear indication of how this will be achieved (assuming i did not previously know what twitter was).</p>

    <p>MY CASE STUDY: STARBUCKS</p>
<p>"Establish Starbucks as the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world while maintaining our uncompromising principles as we grow. The following six guiding principles will help us measure the appropriateness of our decisions: </p>
<p>Provide a great work environment and treat each other with respect and dignity. </p>
<p>Embrace diversity as an essential component in the way we do business. </p>
<p>Apply the highest standards of excellence to the purchasing, roasting and fresh delivery of our coffee. </p>
<p>Develop enthusiastically satisfied customers all of the time. </p>
<p>Contribute positively to our communities and our environment. </p>
<p>Recognize that profitability is essential to our future success."</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.samples-help.org.uk/mission-statements/starbucks-mission-statement.htm" title="http://www.samples-help.org.uk/mission-statements/starbucks-mission-statement.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.samples-help.org.uk/mission-statements/starbucks-mission-stat...</a> </p>
<p>Above is Starbucks mission statement. From what I’ve learned so far in the video provided for lesson 1, this statement is far too long and not customer focused. But then I got to thinking, Starbucks has been in business quite and while and is very successful. It got me wondering what the mission statement was when the company started… and when and where and how they started. </p>
<p>I found on Wikipedia some info answering all of the above questions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks</a> </p>
<p>This lead me to learn it was Schultz who took the company to where it is today. I discovered the above mission statement was the original and has now been updated to this:</p>
<p>Starbucks’ mission statement is: “To inspire and nurture the human spirit— one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.</p>
<p>This was also confirmed by viewing the Starbucks corporate website <a href="http://me.starbucks.com/en-US/_About+Starbucks/Mission+Statement.htm" title="http://me.starbucks.com/en-US/_About+Starbucks/Mission+Statement.htm" rel="nofollow">http://me.starbucks.com/en-US/_About+Starbucks/Mission+Statement.htm</a>.</p>
<p>Now this statement is much more succinct and customer driven. Now I am thinking about if a mission statement is so important, and needs to be succinct and customer driven, how did Starbucks get to be so successful with the original one?</p>
<p>Here’s my personal answer and my opinion: Yes, a mission statement is important to provide clear vision.  But it seems to be more based on the feelings and emotions of the person in charge. How that individual connects with the statement. Those original words Schultz and his mission were obviously core values to him. Even though to me it seems to be too long and not customer focused, this is irrelevant. </p>
<p>In closing then I would have to say that a mission statement needs to be clear and concise to the person developing the business. After all, when was the last time you checked out someone’s mission statement prior to doing business with them?</p>
<p>So, to wrap it up I would say I have learned this: If my mission doesn’t light me up… it’s not clear enough.</p>

    <p>The word "Premier" seems to be used in this way only in mission statements, but without quantifying a goal. "The Premier provider" is harder to prove than a goal of selling the most cups of coffee or having the most stores. </p>
<p>[edit: Agree that the second version is a lot more inspiring, and it doesn't need quantifying.]</p>

    <p>Zappos. (zappos.com)</p>
<p>Mission: to provide the best customer service possible (aka the WOW factor)</p>
<p>I found no vision statement, thou they have the “Zappos Family Core Values”:</p>
<p>1.	Deliver WOW Through Service<br />
2.	Embrace and Drive Change<br />
3.	Create Fun and A Little Weirdness<br />
4.	Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded<br />
5.	Pursue Growth and Learning<br />
6.	Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication<br />
7.	Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit<br />
8.	Do More With Less<br />
9.	Be Passionate and Determined<br />
10.	Be Humble</p>

<a href="http://about.zappos.com/" title="http://about.zappos.com/" rel="nofollow">http://about.zappos.com/</a></p>
<p>Strengths:<br />
This approach is definitely inspirational, it is 100% customer focused, they understand the concerns related with the online purchase and they do their best to address those and gain the customer. For me, clothing is one of the most difficult things to sell online because you cant never be sure if it fits. Zappos mission and values are focused in increasing your shopping experience.<br />
It is definitely memorable, short, and does reflect the reality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:<br />
If you don’t know Zappos or have not bought from them then you might get the impression that they might not be a serious business, although I doubt you will go check their values before purchasing xD.<br />
Also, it does not tell you what the company is about. I’m not sure if it should but it could be anything by only looking at the statement.</p>

    <p>Zappo's overdelivers on their mission statement, at least in my opinion. I have read nothing but good reviews about this company (I have not used them) on the internet and in print. They use social media, phone and email to overdeliver their promised customer service. I read that they even pay their customer reps hourly instead of performance based so that they will all do a good job. I also read that the employees absolutely love working for Zappo's.</p>

    <p>The mission statement for FactCheck.org:</p>
<p>We are a nonpartisan, nonprofit "consumer advocate" for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in U.S. politics. We monitor the factual accuracy of what is said by major U.S. political players in the form of TV ads, debates, speeches, interviews and news releases. Our goal is to apply the best practices of both journalism and scholarship, and to increase public knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>I think this is a well-written mission statement. Most statements for news organizations were not so good.</p>
<p>Strengths: The statement is very focused by zeroing in on who the site is for and what it will do for them and how the job will be done. It's for voters and it serves them by reducing misinformation.</p>
<p>The trustworthy ethos of FactCheck.org is apparent in this statement, so it would be impossible to read this and not understand what they are about. With a statement this clear, you can picture who will use your services and how they will be helped, so that probably means that employees don't suffer any lack of clarity or disagreements about their tasks. </p>
<p>Weaknesses: I'm not sure who is a "major political player" or how this site defines the "best practices of journalism and scholarship," but those are minor questions. I wonder whether it's possible to be a nonpartisan factchecker these days. </p>
<p>The weaknesses of the organization itself seem to be that (1.) it is likely to make a lot of people angry, but it also needs to receive gifts of money like any other nonprofit -- and sooner or later those two goals could be in conflict; (2.) there's an open question whether voters use facts and logic, or vote with their emotions, so you have to wonder whether most people read the site to search for ammunition that they can use in partisan debates. In other words, are they really serving the people they think, for the reasons they think?</p>

    <p>From Google:</p>
<p>Google’s mission is to organize the world‘s information and make it universally accessible and useful.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1996, Stanford University graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin built a search engine called “BackRub” that used links to determine the importance of individual web pages. By 1998 they had formalized their work, creating the company you know today as Google.</p>
<p>Since then, Google has grown by leaps and bounds. From offering search in a single language we now offer dozens of products and services—including various forms of advertising and web applications for all kinds of tasks—in scores of languages. And starting from two computer science students in a university dorm room, we now have thousands of employees and offices around the world.</p>
<p>On these pages, you can find more information about Google’s products and services, our principles, history, company culture and more. A lot has changed since the first Google search engine appeared. But some things haven’t changed: our dedication to our users and our belief in the possibilities of the Internet itself. </p>
<p>Strengths: The mission statement itself is short and somewhat memorable. While it isn't all encompassing, it is a good ethos for Google employees to follow (and for their customers to know about). It is great for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Weakensses: It doesn't really cover everything that Google does. Yes it makes all information on the Web more accessible, but more often than not their AdWords are not really useful to me and doesnt really show me data I want to see. There are plenty of other products of theirs that dont really make data more accessible.</p>
<p>The mission statement is definitely memorable, but its not really culture defining.</p>

    <p>Yes, this might be the company's *official* mission statement, but the one that people remember is short, punchy and to the point: "DON'T BE EVIL." It's an amazing mission statement that seemed to sum-up the ethics of a company that wanted all of your personal information. They were saying "We want to organise the world's information - your information - but we promise to be responsible." This was a reaction for Microsoft's abuses of power and getting hauled before the dock by the Department of Justice. </p>
<p>As many of us know, Google are now widely seen to be in breach of it's core values - the "unofficial" one - that resonates with the public: illegally collecting personal data, corrupting "open source" ethics, seen to be in bed with China over censorship and closing their eyes to human-rights violations... they are too numerous to name.</p>

    <p>I decided to focus on Coca Cola for my case study and look at their vision and mission</p>
<p>Our Mission</p>
<p>Our Roadmap starts with our mission, which is enduring. It declares our purpose as a company and serves as the standard against which we weigh our actions and decisions.</p>
<p>    * To refresh the world...<br />
    * To inspire moments of optimism and happiness...<br />
    * To create value and make a difference.</p>
<p>Our Vision<br />
Our vision serves as the framework for our Roadmap and guides every aspect of our business by describing what we need to accomplish in order to continue achieving sustainable, quality growth.</p>
<p>    * People: Be a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be.<br />
    * Portfolio: Bring to the world a portfolio of quality beverage brands that anticipate and satisfy people's desires and needs.<br />
    * Partners: Nurture a winning network of customers and suppliers, together we create mutual, enduring value.<br />
    * Planet: Be a responsible citizen that makes a difference by helping build and support sustainable communities.<br />
    * Profit: Maximize long-term return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities.<br />
    * Productivity: Be a highly effective, lean and fast-moving organization.</p>
<p>Overall I feel that the Vision and Mission is quite wordy and certainly creates huge expectation. ie. to inspire moments of optimism and happiness (it is a drink...!)<br />
However I do see these mission and vision expressed in their advertising campaigns and they way that they market their products.</p>
<p>One thing I found really interesting was the statement about Planet: be a responsible citizen? I guess I see things a little differently but there is a serious problem with excess plastics in the world, including the pacific ocean garbage dump. How would you define a responsible citizen...?</p>
<p>Having said all that looking at the vision and mission I think that it is inspiring and comprehensive, one that is marketable and easily communicated to potential customers, staff and investors.</p>

    <p>Here is a long, but in my mind, strong Mission Statement - I actually liked reading it, didn't get bored and it spoke to me. I didn't go to Naropa University, but have friends that do and have:</p>
<p>"Mission Statement</p>
<p>Inspired by the rich intellectual and experiential traditions of East and West, Naropa University is North America's leading institution of contemplative education.</p>
<p>Naropa recognizes the inherent goodness and wisdom of each human being. It educates the whole person, cultivating academic excellence and contemplative insight in order to infuse knowledge with wisdom. The university nurtures in its students a lifelong joy in learning, a critical intellect, the sense of purpose that accompanies compassionate service to the world, and the openness and equanimity that arise from authentic insight and self-understanding. Ultimately, Naropa students explore the inner resources needed to engage courageously with a complex and challenging world, to help transform that world through skill and compassion, and to attain deeper levels of happiness and meaning in their lives.</p>
<p>Drawing on the vital insights of the world's wisdom traditions, the university is simultaneously Buddhist-inspired, ecumenical and nonsectarian. Naropa values ethnic and cultural differences for their essential role in education. It embraces the richness of human diversity with the aim of fostering a more just and equitable society and an expanded awareness of our common humanity.</p>
<p>A Naropa education—reflecting the interplay of discipline and delight—prepares its graduates both to meet the world as it is and to change it for the better."<br />
______________________</p>
<p>I really like the last line - the alliteration and juxtaposition of "discipline and delight" and I like the intent to help people meet the world as it is, and work to change it for the better. I not usually so altruistic, and I am rather surprised at my response to this. I usually like really pithy statements. However, this feels very well crafted, particularly the first line and the last line. There is a quality of presence or awakeness in the language that speaks to me, and would for at least a strong portion of the audience I am seeking to reach. How does this hit other people?</p>

    <p>I've decided to write about Groupon's Mission statement.</p>
<p>We treat our customers the way we like to be treated. We sell stuff we want to buy. No BS. Unbelievable customer service.</p>
<p>Strengths:  The business focuses on finding deals and emerged during a time where financially strapped consumers were the norm.  It focuses, like Zappos, on customer service as a key differentiator and more subtley, it focuses on the varied interests of its founders and staff.  A key difference from a company that produces a product that aims to sell said product.  Instead, through varied interests and social recommendation, they 'sell' relevant products to a common audience that spans age groups and appeals to their thrifty/discount hunting nature. </p>
<p>Weaknesses:  The No BS factor.  It's easy for smaller, hungrier companies to create a service/product that caters to its clients/customers when it is a manageable amount of customer satisfaction issues.  It will be interesting to see how this part plays out as the company spans nations and increases their size in each market.  Zappos is a great example of a company growing but still holding on to its ideals....but most companies lose that as they go 'corporate'.</p>

    <p>I'm surprised that Groupon has resorted to using "No BS" in their mission statement. It seems that they're trying to be cool and hip, but it's in bad taste. Contrary to their mission statement, I have not experienced "unbelievable customer service" from Groupon. It will be interesting to see how Groupon holds up to competitors like Living Social, who just partnered up with Amazon. Sources say that Amazon invested $175 million in Living Social. Groupon is going to have to step up their game to stay ahead of their competition.</p>

    <p>I agree with Dennis in that it is hard for them to keep their values while growing at the pace they are doing it.<br />
Here in Colombia we also have Groupon and let me tell you its no good. They sell spa's and beauty stuff everyday. No BS.</p>
<p>Another aspect I find controversial is the fact that they promote their customer service. As I see it, Groupon is a company that sells discounted products/services and thus only applies for the transaction, not the final product or service. I even logged to Groupon to check if they had a visible help link, email address or phone to call, but they dont.<br />
To reinforce my point this is from the Groupon Promise page:<br />
"... And here’s one our lawyers made us throw in: we’re not the merchant, so while we’ll accept a return if you feel like Groupon did something that let you down..."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.groupon.com/blog/cities/the-groupon-promise/" title="http://www.groupon.com/blog/cities/the-groupon-promise/" rel="nofollow">http://www.groupon.com/blog/cities/the-groupon-promise/</a></p>
<p>So I do like Groupon as they provide a valuable service but their mission in my opinion does not reflect their business.</p>

    <p>The company I have choosen is Bayer:</p>
<p>Its mission statement is: “Bayer: Science For A Better Life”.</p>
<p>They define their company as an inventor company with a long tradition of research and they apply the major global challenges so they deliver innovations that address unmet customer anb market needs.</p>
<p>Its values can be summarized by the term LIFE because Bayer’s corporate culture is an important factor in the company’s success. Central to this culture are its values: Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility and Eficieny. As you see, if you join the first letter of every word you get the word LIFE.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this mission statement has its strong points in the fact that it’s short, memorable and inspiring. It’s convincing and not fluffy. </p>
<p>As a weak point, I think that althought it explains the purpose of the organization, you wouldn’t know what it is talking about when you read it if the name of the company (Bayer) wasn’t in the statement. If you only read “Science for a better life” you won’t identify the company because it’s a general idea.  Too general in my opinion.</p>
<p>Vision Statement:</p>
<p>I haven’t found specificaly the vision statetment of the company but they say:</p>
<p>“Our focus on innovation is the key to maintaining or gaining a leading position in every market in which we operate. It is also the foundation for improving the lives of many millons of people”</p>
<p>Reading this, I think that their objectives are to be the best company in their sector.  It’s a superlative vision statement. They want to be leaders in all markets they oper.</p>

    <p>Hi Cristina,</p>
<p>My thoughts on your case study are:</p>
<p>I agree with you on the mission statement being to general but also feel that BAYER is a recognized brand so they might be able to get away with being so short with their mission statement.  On the other hand I believe that BAYER could have and should have gone a little further into detail by highlighting a couple of concrete ideals/markets they are involved with.</p>
<p>I will follow your case study as we progress through class as your thoughts, feedback and the company have all caught my interest.</p>
<p>Take Care,</p>
<p>Doug</p>

    <p>Marlene’s Market and Deli – two locations, one in Tacoma and one in Federal Way, WA</p>
<p>“Marlene’s Market and Deli is committed to providing shoppers with the best and widest selection of organic and natural whole foods and ecologically-sound products available.  Our friendly staff is trained to assist you in choosing the best products and services for your needs and to be as helpful and informative as possible.  From our aisles to our deli to our weekly lectures and cooking classes, Marlene’s Market and Deli is you partner in a naturally healthy lifestyle.”</p>
<p>I do 95% of my shopping here and they stand up to this mission statement.  I think the strengths are its clarity and breadth while being concise.  It seems to cover the “What do we do?” and “How do we do it?” very well.  I don’t know about the “For whom do we do it?” part, maybe it is just assumed that the people who would want these services would be people inclined to a “naturally healthy lifestyle.”  It is appealing to me and I would imagine to anyone else interested in that lifestyle.  And it is intriguing, especially if I didn’t know anything about the store. </p>
<p>I can’t think of any weaknesses in this statement, it sums up everything about the stores (which are awesome!).</p>

    <p>Ashley,</p>
<p>I think Marlene's is a great choice for a mission statement. I'm a Tacoma guy myself and I agree completely with you that they "stand up to this mission statement". </p>
<p>I think the "For whom do we do it?" is covered by them saying "shoppers".</p>
<p>Overall though I think they really nail it and it shows if you shop there.</p>

    <p>I chose to focus on Chick-Fil-A and compared it to McDonald's. Here are the two links for the mission statements: <a href="http://www.chick-fil-a.com/#facts" title="http://www.chick-fil-a.com/#facts" rel="nofollow">http://www.chick-fil-a.com/#facts</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company/mcd_faq/student_research.html" title="http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company/mcd_faq/student_research.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company/mcd_faq/student_research.html</a>. If you take a quick glance at the two URLs, you will notice that Chick-Fil-A's statement was rather easy to find - I only had to go one page off of the home page and there it was. On the other hand, I really had to dig for McDonald's statement. It wasn't even on the main site - mcdonalds.com.</p>
<p>I chose to compare the two because both of these companies are rather well known, they are both in the same type of market (fast food), and I thought their statements would be similar. I was right and wrong. Chik-Fil-A concentrates on America while McDonald's has a global reach - otherwise their wording is similar. Here are their statements:</p>
<p>Chik-Fil-A:<br />
"Be America's Best Quick-Service Restaurant"</p>
<p>McDonald's:<br />
"Be our customers' favorite place and way to eat"</p>
<p>Chik-Fil-A is laser targeted on who they want as their target market - but they have shortsighted themselves if they decide to expand outside of the USA. They know they don't want to compete with regular sit-down, more upscale restaurants - their focus is on fast food restaurants - and I think this is smart. They know their niche and they have stayed within it and have dominated it with their chicken sandwiches. But notice that their mission statement did not mention anything about chicken, which they are well known for. I think this is also smart. This allows them room to grow - just in case they do decide to move outside of their niche of chicken. I don't see that happening, since it has worked since their inception in the 1960's, but you never know...</p>

    <p>I've decided on Beatport's mission statement for my case study.  Beatport is a online music store for electronic dance music DJs. </p>
<p>Beatport Mission Statement:</p>
<p>Music. Technology. Culture. Design. Beatport is the most relevant online source of electronic music in the world</p>
<p>Strengths: This statement is short and memorable. There are many market-oriented, DJ-centric buzzwords. It has a hip and stylish vibe, which speaks well to the targeted demographic. </p>
<p>Weaknesses: The memorable buzzwords are also cliche' and overused.  The grammatical structure is a bit odd. This statement exudes a pretentious attitude.</p>

    <p>Google Mission Statement:<br />
• Google’s mission is to organize the world‘s information and make it universally accessible and useful.</p>
<p>Strengths:<br />
• Short and sweet<br />
• Dominant<br />
• Far reaching<br />
• Clear and concise<br />
• Engages the employee and drives corporate initiative</p>
<p>Weaknesses:<br />
• It is too far reaching when thinking about what it’s says to the consumer.  It doesn’t really tell the consumer anything except that they (Google) have a huge task in-front of them.<br />
• Does not stand out from the rest of the technology/internet companies.  Not consumer focused again when compared to their competition.<br />
• I can make information organized, useful and accessible, so what does Google bring to the table.</p>
<p>Memorable, Inspirational, Etc-Why?:<br />
• It is very memorable in the sole fact that is so far reaching.  The mission statement is a huge, almost unattainable goal.  That being said, this is both memorable and not memorable.  If I put on an employee hat and read that statement, wow, I am energized.  If I put on my consumer hat, eh…not really told anything that tells me what Google is going to do for me.</p>

    <p>“At Trader Joe's, our mission is to bring our customers the best food and beverage values and the information to make informed buying decisions. There are more than 2000 unique grocery items in our label, all at honest everyday low prices. We work hard at buying things right: Our buyers travel the world searching for new items and we work with a variety of suppliers who make interesting products for us, many of them exclusive to Trader Joe’s. All our private label products have their own "angle," i.e., vegetarian, Kosher, organic or just plain decadent, and all have minimally processed ingredients.”</p>
<p>Strengths:<br />
-	Detailed; specifics on what they want to achieve and how they do it<br />
-	Informative &amp; interesting<br />
-	Stresses their commitment to the customer, and the customers health<br />
Weaknesses:<br />
-	A little long, but you come away with key facts<br />
I do most of my grocery shopping here, and they definitely uphold their statement. There is always a large variety of items to choose from. While “minimally processed ingredients” means that most foods are seasonal and not available year round, it also means their foods are fresher and healthier for you, which is the main reason I was drawn to the store in the first place. It is very easy to find foods for a specific diet, such as Kosher or vegan, because everything is clearly labeled. And it doesn’t hurt that you can save about 40% or more over traditional grocery stores, either!</p>

    <p>I chose “The Impossible Project”, a start-up that revived the nearly-extinct Polaroid film format. </p>
<p>What was titan of  20th Century business and a miracle of engineering succumbed in the new millenium to catastrophic mismanagement and the march of new technology. Impossible rode the back of a grassroots internet campaign called “Save Polaroid!”, salvaging enough machinery and technical expertise from the rubble to re-create the film from the ashes.</p>
<p>It’s mission statement is bold: “Don’t undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible.” This was a phrase taken from the iconic inventor of the format, the late Dr. Edwin Land. It is powerful.</p>
<p>Strengths: aspirational, challenging, personal.<br />
It asks the customer to step up!; be important and do great things. It stirs our inner passion, asking us to strive for the impossible and step outside of our comfort zones. In this sense, it is remiscent of Nike’s “Just Do It” - imploring us to act. Unlike Nike - whose call-to-arms is somewhat impulsive and raw, it imparts an implicit intelligence upon us, asking us to carefully discern when and where we enter the fray. This is at least reflected in the premium price.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: self-important, cerebral, wordy. This is no impulse buy! Although thoughtful, it is a mouthful.<br />
It is also non-specific, not referring to the business in any way.</p>

    <p>I chose Patagonia as a company who really embodies their mission statement. Patagonia is famous for making high-priced outdoor clothes and some equipment. </p>
<p>Their mission is statement:</p>
<p>"Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis."</p>
<p>Having used Patagonia products I can tell you right away that they don't break. But in the off chance something happens to cause it to malfunction they'll replace it right away. They're so confident that they create the best product that they'll do anything to make sure a customer is satisfied.</p>
<p>After reading the founder of Patagonia's biography, I can tell you that Patagonia goes to great lengths to make sure that their products don't cause unnecessary harm to the outdoors that consumers of Patagonia products love so much. </p>
<p>Patagonia does a great job of promoting awareness through it's products. As a consumer they make you very aware of causes they're working for and towards.</p>
<p>Strengths: Inspirational, Honest - Patagonia has spent years crafting and perfecting their mission statement. Additionally the whole company is involved and believes in it. Their mission statement speaks to exactly who they are and what they do. </p>
<p>Weaknesses: Not everyone wants to buy clothes for a cause. Patagonia wears it's environmental heart on its sleeve and not everyone supports that, whether for better or for worse.</p>

<p>I think the vision says what they are daily working on. It's true that with every campaing, video, blog post... they are contributing to build an open democratic society; as they always put a lot of effort in making viral campaings (using Facebook, blogs, petitions, inviting important artists, developing facebook apps..) that can bring the news, the information and the testimonial of the people affected to more people worldwide.</p>
<p>About the mission I think it is clear and it express what they do and why they do it. And it also complements the vision by saying how they are plan to accomplish the goal of an open democratic society what do you think??</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>My case study is Sage Fly Rods (<a href="http://www.sageflyfish.com/" title="http://www.sageflyfish.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sageflyfish.com/</a>). Their "Statement of Purpose" says "We are passionate about our business of creating fly fishing products that continually exceed the fly angler's expectations. Wherever in the world your fly fishing takes you, it is safe to say that Sage has the products to enhance your fly fishing experience." In 1980 when Sage was founded it was a bit shorter... "to build the world's finest performance fly rods."</p>
<p>The strengths of the original mission are it is very short, concise and memorable. It isn't necessarily market oriented or inspirational but did serve the company well as they do build the finest fly rods in the world. (Full disclosure here: I do own a number of Sage rods and highly recommend them as a former fly fishing instructor and guide :-))</p>
<p>The new "Statement of Purpose" to me is a bit long but reflects a change in business of focussing on being more market oriented and aimed at the consumer of their products while maintaining the drive to make "fly fishing products"...exceeding expectations." It is definitely not as memorable and concise but I like the focus on their customer's experience and it is a bit inspirational compared to the original. Thoughts?</p>

    <p>Hi Randy,</p>
<p>I completely agree with what you have written and as you seem to be passionate about fly fishing yourself I believe they have created a mission statement that sings with you (the consumer).</p>
<p>The second mission statement seems to expand on the first,  but by adding unnecessary words: for eg do they need to say it is safe to say?  Or could they have left that out for a heavier impact - sometimes I feel people place words in sentences to make them seem more full, but in reality it takes away from the statement.</p>
<p>We are passionate about our business of creating fly fishing products that continually exceed the fly angler's expectations. Wherever in the world your fly fishing takes you, Sage has the products to enhance your fly fishing experience.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Lori :)</p>

    <p>I totally agree with you Lori. I feel the second statement is too wordy. Given the term "fly fishing" is used in the first sentence it could be re-worded to say "We are passionate about our business of creating fly fishing products that continually exceed the fly angler's expectations. Wherever in the world your fly fishing takes you, Sage has the products to enhance your experience."</p>

    <p>Lululemon</p>
<p>Mission Statement: creating components for people to live a longer, healthier, more fun life.</p>
<p>To be honest I am a little torn on my feelings for this mission statement, in a lot of ways I feel its strengths could also represent its weaknesses – I guess this comes down to a better understanding of mission statements on my part.</p>
<p>I believe the mission statement makes sense if you know the background to the company. For eg Lululemon was created to provide high-end women’s athletic apparel and also inspire woman (and now men) to focus more heavily on exercise to boost health.  As a previous employee much of this is taught to you through training and I feel the mission statement just doesn’t do the business and its success justice.</p>
<p>Strengths:  Short and creative, it leaves a lot to the imagination and is not bound by any real parameters instead of saying clothing they focus on components, broadening their market choices.  I feel it is inspirational using words such as live a longer, more fun life.  I also think they leave themselves wide open to really market the company as a place to source a greater life, that’s really what they are trying to sell: a better existence.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: I don’t know that it is measurable? According to Wikipedia a mission statement should: tell you the fundamental purpose of the organization. It defines the customer and the critical processes. It informs you of the desired level of performance, Microsoft also points to this in the video.</p>
<p>Does anyone think this mission statement does that? I guess the international success is an indicator that they are providing to the market. </p>
<p>I also think it could be more clear and precise – how are they creating components and what are the components that provide value to the consumer is it simply their clothes or their commitment to the community?</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Lori </p>

    <p>Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.<br />
–Patagonia's Mission Statement</p>
<p>This mission comes from a company I have great respect for.  It admirable and noble but does not say what they build or make.  I still like it anyway ha.</p>
<p>The idea that a company take on such a large problem like the environmental crisis that affects the entire planet is something that we should all take notice of. </p>

    <p>I chose the mission statement from Whirlpool Corporation the global appliance manufacturer:<br />
Every home, every where, with pride, passion and performance. </p>
<p>Strengths: Straightforward and to the point. Everyone needs appliances and their goal is to be part of everyone's lives through their appliances , which leads to higher market share and profits. </p>
<p>Weaknesses: It is hard to imagine or represent the pride and passion in an industrial product since these are subjective values and they do not necessarily connect with how they improve or change their customers lives for the better. For example the GE Corporation br mission statement is more approachable and does speak to the value they bring to their customers: Imagine, solve, build and lead .</p>
