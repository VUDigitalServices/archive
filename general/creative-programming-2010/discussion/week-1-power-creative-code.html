    <p>This first week&#39;s objective is to understand computer programming&#39;s potential for creative work. Most people associate computer code with complicated highly abstract problem-solving, particularly engaged with creating software, databases, and other functional tools.</p>
<p>The group will read, write and discuss around the role(s) of computer programming as part of the toolkit for creative artists and designers. Some group members may confirm and find support for their existing perceptions on this topic, others may find new meanings that challenge their ideas. In all, the outcome of this week&#39;s work is to lay the personal and group foundations for the rest of the course.</p>
<p>Participants are invited to read the following three essays, all freely available online:</p>
<p>
	- Harold Cohen&#39;s &quot;<a class="ext" href="http://crca.ucsd.edu/%7Ehcohen/cohenpdf/onpurpose.pdf" rel="nofollow">On Purpose</a>&quot; (1974);&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>In my reading of this week's assigned essays, it is the notion of process and its relationship to art making and creative practices (both 'traditional' and computer/machine 'assisted') that I find most intriguing. C.E.B Reas observes that despite a long and established history of artists exploring themes of process and system in their work, there is a surprising deficit of artists actually engaging computer software in their practice “despite the natural confluence.” This idea of an apparent confluence or affinity between the creative process of the artist and the computer/machine executing a line of code opens up a number of interesting questions. In the following brief paragraphs I will share some of my preliminary reflections on the matter and welcome the insight and responses of others. What I am offering is more of a prompt for questioning and discussion than a concrete position as such.</p>
<p>As artists or creative professionals we often talk about our work as a process, the ubiquitous “creative process.” This process entails every aspect of the creative endeavour, from the initial inspiration and the research involved in giving form to our ideas, to the execution of our work, and finally in some instances the product of that work itself—the art or 'artefact' of our making may be regarded as an extension or continuation of the process or perhaps its own unique process. In his essay, On Purpose, Harold Cohen describes the inner functions of a computer system executing a given set of instructions or (codes) as a process. “The 'operations room' of the whole machine [is] appropriately enough called the Central Processing Unit...” Inquiring into the possible roles of the computer in art, Cohen takes up the position that “machine behaviour shares some very fundamental characteristics with what we normally regard as art-making behaviour.” He goes on to define a fundamental characteristic of the computer as a “symbol-manipulating machine... capable of dealing with any problem which can be given a symbolic representation.” Art, it may be said, is a realm of expression not unfamiliar with the symbolic. Symbolism has always been an expressive tool available to the artist and continues to figure prominently in contemporary art. However, to consider the artist in terms such as Cohen suggests, as a “symbol-manipulating machine” brings to focus a number of problems and questions that need addressing. </p>
<p>Perhaps the best way I can begin to unpack these questions and offer my reflections on them is to clarify that it is not Cohen's use of the word “machine”—in so far as that word has come to hold a bevy of negative and anti-humanist connotations in our enlightened modern imagination—that I find problematic. My issue is rather more subtle and has to do with exactly what role, or more specifically at what point in the great mechanistic cog of the creative process is the artist situated when the computer is introduced as a tool for art making? Is the computer merely an aide in the art making process, or does it constitute the process itself? Again, where does the artist factor in this process: as the instigator-general of ideas translated into computer-understandable symbolic expressions? Is this art making or button-pushing? For arguments sake, if we consider the creative process as a motion proceeding from the artist, moving through the creative act of making itself, and coming to rest in the art (or perhaps not coming to rest at all... perhaps triggering other uncontrollable processes), metaphysically speaking, where does the machine begin and where does the individual artist end? Cohen defines the artist as one who uses art as a means to modify himself. All our encounters with tools modify the human being in some respect; the arm that swings the hammer in some way becomes an extension of the hammer, the hand and hammer and whole body at once given over to the task of hammering. This is an instrumental view of the individual's relationship with tools. Indeed Cohen uses this metaphor to give an ontological definition of the machine. “While the machine is running a user's program it can't do anything else, so that you might say the machine is identified by the program.” The instrumental view of the individual's relationship with tools and things can be reversed to give a more balanced picture: in the act of hammering, the hammer may modify the body but it does not define the individual. In fact the reverse is true, in so far as the hammer is a thing made for human uses and ends, it is the human that gives definition and meaning to the hammer. The very shape of the tool showing evidence of responding to the specific demands of the human form. The hammer is in this way an extension of the human form, and receives its final meaning from the human, and not the other way around. </p>
<p>So where does this metaphysical-ontological detour leave us with respect to the discussion at hand about artists and computers? When we engage the computer as a tool we are extending and surpassing the corporeal limits of our bodies (and arguably the mind) to engage forms and representations that could not otherwise be expressed by us. But are we really the ones directing the expressions? Again, where does the human begin and the computer end if both are locked in one continuous process—the human reaching forth into the computer in an attempt to transcend limitations of space and time (yes) only to discover that the machine is essentially a rudimentary and primitive creature, a creature that forces the artist to reframe her creative position in a language that is understandable to the machine. Creative censorship! (?) This language is a symbolic language, but not symbolic in the richly nuanced way of the creative imagination, it is a language of symbols that require every postulation take the form of a simple problem or question. The basic grammar of this language, once you descend from the “higher level” languages (to quote Cohen) is an essentially mathematical one: 'add', 'subtract,' 'multiply,' 'divide,' 'compare,' 'move this into memory,' 'move this out of memory.' etc. </p>
<p>At the end of this process, what are we left with? Is this art? Given the unique limitations of the medium, have we exercised free creative vision? Where is our hand in the actual making of this thing?  Are we artists or have we merely set into motion a set of instructions and open variables? I'm not sure myself. It would appear that in this context we are designers. Design, from the latin root designare, meaning “to mark-out, devise, choose, designate, appoint.” Does this distinction even matter?</p>

    <p>Limitation vs. Control</p>
<p>This was originally a bit longer, but I've cut it down to stick closer to the 600-800 word request.  To sum up what was cut, I'll just say that it was mostly discussing the slight differences between art and design and how art can be a little bit more free-form whereas there is often more of a science to design.</p>
<p>The abstraction of the inner workings of a program from the user interface is usually considered a good idea when writing a program.  A real-world example is giving the driver of a car control of the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes but not control of when the individual pistons in the engine are firing.  But, the important point here is where do you put that abstraction barrier?  How much control do you allow, and at what point does either simplicity or freedom of control begin to hinder the work-flow?</p>
<p>It's obvious that making a program simple to use is usually a good idea.  As it was stated in the CEDS paper: “Our CEDS must keep designers doing what they are best at: designing. We must not turn them into computer scientists.”  One way to do that is by adding well planned limitations. </p>
<p>And, limitations can also be a critical part of a design.  If you wanted to line up certain elements of a design along a particular line on an axis, it may be tedious to do this by hand without some limits of where you can move elements to.  You might use a "snap" feature that only allows you to move elements along a grid or guides that you set up.  So, these kind of limits can help automate tasks when needed.  Musicians also use this concept to restrict them from playing outside of predefined note divisions (every 16th note or every 32nd note, etc) and call it quantization.  A producer of a commercial dance track would probably find quantization to be essential.</p>
<p>The downside to this is that the user may hit a brick wall (the abstraction barrier) when they've exhausted all possibilities that the imposed limitations allow.  "What if I could rotate this rectangle to a degree of 91.5 degrees instead of only 90 degrees?" might be the flip side to "snapping".  And, a creatively oriented musician might think such quantization makes their music too machine-like.  The slight variations and mistakes in the timing could be what makes their song interesting.</p>
<p>So, this ultimately limits the creative permutations available to the artist.  If they are no longer creating something that is new and different, is it still art?  This is where allowing finer and finer control can be a major benefit to creativity.  A designer, on the other hand, may specifically want to re-use elements and patterns because they have been proven to work or for consistency in a design.</p>
<p>Besides being able to finely tweak controls themselves, computer generated permutations may be beneficial to both artists and designers.  Limits may be needed in both cases to help prevent the choice paralysis that can occur from having too many possible permutations.  But, the preferred limits may differ between the two groups.  An artist may be content to explore variations indefinitely or until it feels finished.  Whereas, a designer may need to finish their work in a shorter time frame and thus prefer more limitation.</p>
<p>And, as far as the aesthic quality of these computer generated permutations, there may again be some variance in preference between artists and designers.  An artist may be able to get away with a completely random looking piece if it seems to convey some idea even if vague, but a designer may have to adhere to a sticter form.  </p>
<p>These are only a few examples and it's not to suggest that a designer would always want limits and an artist would always want more control.  But, it does help illustrate that the battle between limitation and control is almost always present.  As Cohen stated, “For the machine to serve his Purpose the artist will need to use it as he uses himself.”  So, a perfect CEDS or any tool in that spirit will need to be able to adapt to the person using it and offer as much control or limitation that they require.</p>

    <p>In my essay, I fear I point out the obvious, but it was helpful to me personally to digest specifically the concepts of computers that interest me. --</p>
<p>I'm grateful that I get to be alive in a time when the place of computers in art is beginning to be created and understood. I think that there are unique and creative ways to utilize the newfound power of computers that have yet to be discovered, and the idea of exploring new ground excites me. The essays "On Purpose" and "Beyond Code" both illustrate the inescapable truth of creating art with computers, that everything is based in mathematics. After describing the math used to draw simple lines in "On Purpose" the author states "It may not be clear why anyone would want to use such elaborate means to reproduce a drawing he has already made." The author then goes on to explain that the real power of translating art into math is once you teach the computer the basics of our artistic language, such as lines and curves, you can allow the computer to manipulate those fundamental forms to create things we've never made or seen before. The power of using computers for art lies in the differences between artists and computers. Artists grow weary of math long before computers do, they forget facts and numbers long before computers do, and when the artist dies the computer still runs the programs he wrote in the same exact way. </p>
<p>Through recognizing their own strengths and weaknesses as compared to their machine's, the artist can effectively treat the machine as an assistant and collaborator. Like any assistant, the computer does not enter the shop knowing what it should do or how to do it, but if it is taught well it can allow the artist to create things impossible if the artist was working alone. The better the artist and assistant understand each other, through specialized tasks and language the artist teaches the assistant, the more responsibility in creating the art the assistant can take. When the artist understands the strengths and weaknesses of his assistant he can delegate tasks that he knows would be better suited to the assistant, allowing the artist more time to be creative. When the artist requires 1000 circles drawn, he can simply tell the assistant he has taught to draw circles to draw them, while he thinks of the next artistic step, instead of spending that time drawing the circles himself. The power of the machine doesn't end at it's ability to do what it has been taught to the exacting standards of the artist at an exhausting quantity. The machine can also remember things forever, as well as try things over and over.</p>
<p>I think the power of using the computer as an artistic collaborator is the ability for the artist to teach the computer to create a piece of art, effectively "reproducing a drawing he has already made". Once taught, the artist can now talk to his assistant in broader terms. He can try new things, he can explore more new ground because he himself is not obligated to explore every dark corner, he can simply point at every corner, and once illuminated by his assistant, decide in which direction he'd like to go. </p>
<p>Another benefit of machine as collaborator is that if you teach it a certain language, anyone who knows that language can interact with it. If you make that language easy for anyone to understand, anyone can talk to your machine and tell it what to do. If you teach your machine somehow to make incredible pieces of art, you can allow other people tell to tell it how to create the art. In this way, you, your machine, and this other person are all simultaneously collaborating on the piece. Through this collaboration art is created that was never possible with merely the artist and his machine. If you teach your machine to ask 1000 people to control 1000 different variables of your art, you end up collaborating with 1000 people in a way that was never possible before you had your assistant to take care of the tedious details. Through this ability the computer can be used to reflect the real world in a way never before possible in art. You end up with a reflection of the real world, through the artist's perspective, and isn't that what great art is?</p>

    <p>Hi EJ Fox,</p>
<p>your discussion of language as the bridge that facilitates collaboration between the computer and the artist, brings to mind some thoughts I had when reading Reas' essay "Beyond Code." Reas describes a project of his which makes use of the English language (as interpreted by a skilled programmer)  as the executable language rather than standard computer code as we know it. This got me thinking about computer languages and their relationship to our spoken languages and grammar. I'm not a computer programmer (hence my enrolment in this course) and I'm not very familiar with the syntax of computer languages, but I am a technology enthusiast, so inevitably in my daily blog readings I receive news about new versions of programming languages, and sometimes entirely new languages being developed. Often, these languages tout the refinement of the language towards a syntax that is more obviously related to our everyday use of English as a positive feature. They call this code "clean" and "readable" etc.</p>
<p>Well, this got me thinking about what a computer language would look like (and how it would operate) if it adhered very closely to our grammatical use of English. Imagine computer processes being defined by nouns, prepositions and conjunctions, being modified by pronouns and adjectives, and a whole range of other grammatical rules that I don't know about (I'm also not very familiar with formal grammar)... I imagine this new programming language that is based on English, reserving Verbs as the key executing command... imagine composing a line of code, essentially as a sentence, omitting the key verb until the very end, and then...<br />
like magic, the verb executes the code and brings meaning and coherence.</p>
<p>I guess this language would actually look and sound allot like latin.</p>

    <p>You mention the power of translation and how computers may be 'taught' the fundamentals of design and art to create original works. And is this not the essence of creativity?  But if you can teach someone the fundamental principles of drawing and they become an artist of note, can you take credit for their works?  No, but you can take credit for what you have taught them.  In the same sense, if a programmer 'teaches' a computer system the principles of some form of art and the computer then generates completely original and unique works of 'art', how can the programmer take credit for this art and not just for the 'teaching'?</p>
<p>Your observation about computers acting as assistants in the creative process is fantastic and, I think, possibly the ideal situation -  the tireless assistant who does his master's bidding.</p>
<p>Also, the analogy of the 'assistant' exploring the dark corners he is pointed towards is an excellent one and a worthy goal.  Yet, I think the main question to be asked based on your observations is, how would we achieve this?</p>
<p>While I agree to a certain extent with your statements about the collaborative nature of the computer being used to reflect the real world in ways not possible before, I still feel we need to be careful how much credit we give to the creator of a computer programme for the creation of works of art derived from the programme itself.  If I may use the 'Electric Sheep' distributed computing programme as an example – certainly, this was written by a human with a specific vision in mind, it was installed to perform this creative task.  However, once that has happened, the creator doesn't really have any more input into the system.  Hundreds of different computers spread across the globe 'decide' on different parameters and share resources to obtain a specific, original result.  And while this result may be a piece of great art, as you say, I feel that the person who may  originally have been seen as the creator, really only takes on the role of a facilitator.  And while our computers may be able to create great art with a minimal level of input from our side, what happens to the great artist?</p>

<p>Systems design for artistic and creative expression.<br />
In the consideration of systems for use in artistic expression, design, scientific exploration, and analysis, it is crucial for developers to take the users' frames of reference, language, and expectations into account. In order for computer design tools to be effective and easy to use, the uses' workflow should naturally fit into a system's interface and should not be impeded when the user wishes to assert manual control. A highly functional system will allow for exploration and experimentation both within and outside of existing paradigms.</p>
<p>Art, design, science, and analysis are progressive pursuits. They build on the efforts, schema, theories, practices, paradigms, and frameworks that are evolved over generations. As systems evolve to facilitate our exploratory process, commonalities are sometimes discovered between seemingly distinct modes of thinking and creative contexts. By selecting for diverse and robust qualities in software design, common tools and dialects can coalesce out of a seemingly discordant network of industrial specialization and theoretical/perceptual factionalism.</p>
<p>Each area of specialization and exploration, typically, has a uniquely expressive vocabulary of concepts and techniques. In the process of becoming, we absorb, or assimilate, the ideas and practices of our peers while developing our unique conception of emergent phenomena. Pinned to our conceptions are a lexicon of common, generally agreed upon, terms that serve purposes including conveying expressions, critiquing and analysis, and the priming of neural action potentials for conceptual solidification. Systems designers working directly with artists, or even artists designing creative tools themselves, add value to the tools they create by decreasing the conceptual learning curve. They also increase usability by extending their creations out of the practices that are already familiar to many users. A shining example of software developers working in close coordination with artists and designers is the Blender 3D1 project where developers work closely with 3D animators as they create various animated movie projects2. Domain Driven Design3 is a method by which software developers and other stakeholders can communicate ideas and find common ground in order to facilitate a dynamic development approach.</p>
<p>While it is important to work within the artist's vocabulary and conceptual structures, it is also important not to stifle the invention of new methods and genius by constraining the creative process  through traditional channels. “[T]he artist considers one of his<br />
 functions to be the redefinition of the notion of<br />
 art”<br />
 (Cohen, 744). The software design process can facilitate the recursive modification of interface elements and functional components through patterns, such as Model-View-Controller5, that focus on decoupling functionality from the interface. This decoupling generally prevents interface changes from impacting core functionality. This approach also lends well to internationalization as translation is generally a matter of changing interface indicators and software documentation rather than core logic, although the latter may be desirable as well.</p>
<p>The vocabulary used to describe certain activities and document features of various tools can  prevent recognition of potential uses across disciplines and contexts. While activities are being described and labeled, the user is forming implicit associations to semantically related concepts. These associations can overpower less established, germinal, ideas and prevent their emergence. Likewise, vocabulary from one specialization may be disjunct from others while describing the same processes or phenomena. </p>
<p>Design extends beyond written and spoken language into the realm of visual and symbolic interface elements. On-screen elements, sometimes called widgets, can reflect or represent common material objects such as handles, buttons, brushes, &amp;c. These visual queues can transcend the possibilities of textual elements to intuitively convey the purpose that they provide. Users already accustomed to thinking and working in a certain paradigm will benefit from familiar graphical iconifications of tools and processes they engage with on a regular basis. This familiarity can reduce the learning curve and time spent gaining proficiency with a new tool. This reduction in initial training time translates to faster productivity if the user deems the tool as compatible with their desired workflow.</p>
<p>Not only can computer applications emulate expected and generalized behaviors but they can also preform recursive actions based upon minimal user input and intervention. A balance must be found between complete manual control and a system that functions completely without operator feedback. In the case of complete manual control the user gains no efficiency in having the computer as a design aide. In a system that functions without user intervention we lose the power to select for our subjectively desired traits, leaving the computer to decide, mathematically or logically, between aspects usually reserved for the non-liner, less formally logical parts of human consciousness.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we must operate and design at differing levels of consciousness, both individual and collective, in order to facilitate and increase the rate of evolution of creative tools and processes. Cross-discipline collaborations can help strengthen our tools as applied to varying contexts. These  interactions also stimulate discovery and re-contextualization of processes, developed in relative isolation, that have relevance to many fields of study. From this process, a mutual lexicon can evolve, but this lexicon must not be considered as the 'ultimate' expression of our understanding, only as a step in the evolutionary process of discovery and creation.</p>

    <p>The Art Code Evolution</p>
<p>The code have stoped being just a tool to manage information processes from large institutions and corporations to be included in cultural , visual and artistic fields, allowing artists to seek a new tool to express to our world today.</p>
<p>A reflection of the invisible layer where there is the software is difficult to demonstrate, and that is how the term "Digital Art" has been associated primarily with digital images, music or audiovisual installations that use digital technology. The software that controls the data flow generated by the audio and visual information, has often been neglected as a black box behind the scenes. The facilities of an "interactive" for example, are seen as an interaction between a viewer, an exhibition space and an image projection, and not systems where they run codes.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these tools does not disregard the sturdiness of its structure, nor the potential of their operations showing that work is complex but of an extremely artistic impact, which is why when a visual creator develops visual or digital music and compile functions based on codes, there are two issues to be faced: Learning to write source code (software development) or to seek help from a third one, which is not always recommended, because in order to make a good use of such tools is necessary to have solid bases and clear goals to achieve the proposed objectives.</p>
<p>In other words, the code took art to a new state in which a greater number of people can not only view, but be partakers of this phenomenon, proposing and presenting alternatives that are tied to different social scales, from the playful to the practical , making its way through the academic and cultural social project in a tangible way as a seal of a generation that is tired of stereotypes and although still in love with the classical vision and its ability to recreate the world. They return their concepts but apply them in a new language that they understand and accept as their own. On the other hand the digital media power radicates in its infinitely malleable condition, dramatically dynamic, it  passionates a world full of vertigo that is close to a permanence and speed concept that transcends the material, and if we blurred time and space in digital matters, because you can not transcend the expressive and aesthetic, taking different premiums and taking them to even wider levels.</p>
<p>In today's world, the representation needs have changed, the ways in how to read the world are different and as we move towards the simplification of information and communication systems, so do the programs and digital developments, becoming exponentially in a way to find identity through the appropriation of elements away from the crowds, using the resources that it proposes, allowing the individual to grow at their own pace and being a recipient of new information that are quickly transformed into ideas that are applied in case of further complications.</p>
<p>This social paradox is a hallmark of this historic moment in which overpopulation creates an identity crisis because of the emptiness and loneliness that each individual feels, leaving people on the grant decisions of their own decisions, but whether this generic tools immersion can make an appropriation of these elements, process them, make them their own, thanks to even more simple systems, digital art will find itself most welcomed and will face new challenges in which these bits representations can be more like us, so it can be understood differently, carrying these new media, film, multimedia, television, video games, music, interactive installations, digital artwork and all developing aspects to a reality game that will be part of everyday life in the near future.</p>

    <p>I tend to agree with your statement about the 'invisible layer' of software in 'digital art' concept – I also struggle with, a) the actual definition of 'what art is' and, b) where we can draw the line between whether or not something generated by a computer entirely may be considered art.</p>
<p>Where you make your statement about interactive installations being seen only as the interaction and not the systems running the code, I again completely agree. This can also be seen in human interaction with each other, for instance someone who meets a famous celebrity.  They interact with them as a celebrity; as that which they present to the world (the façade, if you wish), rather than considering the whole; the person behind the celebrity.  As such, if a painting may be analysed to the point of discussing the type of brush-stroke, specific pigments mixed to obtain a colour, etc. then surely it is not too far-fetched to consider the programmatic code behind an installation art piece?</p>
<p>When you speak of visual creators having to learn to write source code, I realise that I myself tend to think of artists predominantly in the sense of 'traditional' artist, that is to say people who prefer to use pens, pencils, brushes and clay rather than computers to generate their art.  There are, of course, many people who are multi-faceted in the sense that they enjoy 'traditional' art as well as technology and computers.  I therefore tend to also think that artists are, by definition, averse to using computers and even more so when highly technical aspects are involved.  I myself am in fact such a person who likes traditional art, but also wishes to integrate it with technology.  Where this does however become problematic, is when the technical requirements to execute a particular creative vision far outweigh the creative need, vision or 'flow'.  In other words, when you need to know more about programming than about sculpting to execute your interactive installation, you start venturing, seemingly, more into the world of information technology than the world of art.  As a side-note, I find it an interesting phenomenon that my local University has decided to re-brand their Graphic Design course (which falls under the Art faculty) as 'Information Design', still under the same faculty.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I didn't quite grasp what you were trying to explain in the third-last paragraph.  I'd very much like to get a clarification so that I may consider your essay as a whole.</p>
<p>I think what you mentioned about 'allowing the individual to grow at their own pace' is a critical point – just as with learning how to draw with a pencil (which doesn't require you learning anything new about the pencil), any digital design system needs to allow its user to grow organically at his/her own pace.  That is to say, not knowing certain things about the programme shouldn't restrict your ability to create with it – your ability to create should be your only limitation, and that is what needs to be challenged and advanced.  The other tools and features of design software should actually only allow you to work more efficiently and faster.</p>
<p>In the last paragraph, you mention a selection of different art forms and, if we look at the progression of these art forms and consider the opposition some of these may have experienced when first referred to as 'art forms', the spoken word to plays, plays to the written word, books, films, video games, can we really claim that a film is more of an art than a video game is?  Is it not perhaps an inherent human insecurity (or creator's insecurity) to want to force your view and opinion on people (as in a film, for instance) rather than to let them interact with the work themselves and draw their own conclusions and have their own opinions about it?  Is that not why we possibly consider a film-maker to be an artist, but a game developer merely a programmer?</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Using computer for creative endeavours has pretty much become the order of the day.  Almost every artist in every field of the arts uses a computer to some extent or other.  This often has a somewhat reverse-psychological effect on the creative process, in that artists who are very used to using computers and especially certain software packages, may base their work rather around the tool that they wish to use rather than the concept.  In essence, this is not necessarily a problem, but it does restrict the results.  An artist should decide exactly what it is that the want to do and wish to achieve with a piece of art, then decide on what media they might wish to implement to reach those goals and only then choose which tools the will use to achieve this.</p>
<p>Of course, historically, the tool one wishes to use does play a significant part in the creative process - oil paintings may appear much richer, dramatic and opulent when compared to the fragility and ethereal qualities of watercolours.  However, these are merely individual aspects of a much bigger whole and should not necessarily be the primary motivation for any work of art.</p>
<p>In essence, the tool should not dictate the art; the art (and artist) should dictate the tool.  We may be reaching a point where we are teaching people in creative fields merely how to use the tools and not how to create.  This is a role that a Creative Evolutionary Design System needs to facilitate, and not obfuscate.</p>
<p>As an example, 3D modelling and animation applications have historically been rather unfriendly towards creatively-minded people.  The methods required to 'model' in these applications almost always require a more scientific and mathematical way of thinking rather creative thinking.  Even though the tool does eventually allow the creator to achieve his goal, it is not always very intuitive, and might in fact sometimes prevent the creator from reaching his full creative vision because of the barriers in the process.  Of course, there has also been a lot of progress in this regard, with applications such as ZBrush taking a more natural 'sculpting' process as it's method of interaction rather than the vertex, edge and face-based approach of many other such packages.</p>
<p>Evolution, as a rule, has it as its goal to improve upon existing design - to make stronger, better, faster.  Yet, it's questionable how many of these goals are actually met by computers in the world of art.  If we take a pencil as an example, it can be seen as a perfect tool.  It does exactly what it needs to do, pretty much flawlessly, barring a few minuscule drawbacks such as needing to be sharpened every now and then.  To replace the pencil with a computer system would first and foremost require the computer system to deliver, at the very least, the same functionality that a pencil does.  Then, it needs to improve on that functionality.  In some cases, computers have definitely improved  upon the functionality of the standard pencil.  If we look at the incredible functionality that the combination of Photoshop and a Wacom tablet has added to the artist's toolkit, it is hard to think that anyone would rather want to use a pencil.</p>
<p>But still, unless we can manage to make human-computer interaction seem more natural, it is highly unlikely that the computer would ever replace more traditional tools entirely (think of the paperless office promise that has yet to be fulfilled).  So many Photoshop artists still draw out their designs and drafts in pencil or pen first, then scan it and proceed to work on it in Photoshop.</p>
<p>Alchemy, an application that has recently been gaining some prominence, does however seem to be achieving some of the goals of a Creative Evolutionary Design System.  This tool has a minimal interface - the user has to change very little to the standard start-up settings to be able to start working.  The parameters that can be changed seem rather natural as well and then allows the creator to create 'automatic doodles'.  Even though the creator's input is merely seen as another parameter in the system, it does not give the impression that the computer is creating the work for you.  Since, as much philosophical debate as is possible around the notion of whether or not entirely computer generated 'art' can truly be considered art, no person who sees him- or herself as an artist or has a deep passion for creating things, would ever be satisfied with letting someone or something else take over the creative process for them.</p>
<p>Alchemy is being used, it seems, predominantly as a 'scratch-pad' to provide artists with inspiration and take away that inevitable fear of the blank canvas, but at the very least, as far as a CEDS, it does not alienate and distance the user from his work.  Even if one of the 'brush' settings in the application is 'random', the user still controls the general input and seeds the randomness of the output.</p>
<p>In conclusion, unless we can make the interaction between computers and creators as intuitive and direct as possible (or at least give it the appearance of directness), CEDSs are not likely to ever be widely used by the art community.</p>

    <p>In my opinion the general purpose of the readings is to make us aware there is nothing random about what computers do and that there is a purpose behind everything we do even more so when putting computers and their role into context. Like an Artist working towards his final purpose computers work towards achieving what we define as the purpose is. I was little apprehensive about things because if used to feel somewhere down the line you loose control while using computers but what becomes clear after reading these essays is that maybe I haven't got enough control on the medium as yet and you need time to dissolve these inhibitions.</p>
<p>There are certain inhibitions any designer will face when he uses computer as a new medium, which is the same when you use a pen or pencil. And these inhibitions become less and less as you keep working with the medium. So I think it is faulty to think you are going to face these problems because you are using computers as a medium. It's just that you are new to it and as you become more experienced it would become more of an extension of your body and mind as any great artist in any other medium is. ? So as mentioned in 'Beyond Code' that you adapt a process or a system and you try to interpret and engage with different mediums and try to learn from it and understand it better. </p>
<p>I feel if a medium, which works outside the frameworks of all the programming languages and technology could be developed it would be an evolutionary medium, which would make it more accessible to non-programming genre of people too.</p>
<p>I have always been curious about how you go about things when you see some digital art. My immediate impression was always apart from that It looks cool was if the artist actually meant to do it or if it had any purpose? Even in that case, the same can happen in any other medium liking painting and all. You can't vouch for everyone and say he did it with a purpose. So even of you are using computers as a medium of expression its entirely dependent upon the artist whether he has found any purpose or not.</p>
<p>I am in Compliance with Harold Cohen has to say in his essay in 'Purpose'. It's quite intriguing to see correlations between art making behavior and the machine behavior that has developed it and as an artist gives identity to his work we are giving the machine our identity by defining its purpose. Like a human decision making behavior the machine has the ability to choose completely based upon our input. And the machine follows our purpose at every step elucidates there is nothing arbitrary about what they do. Its up to us to find the process, purpose and structure to define our work and the machine would simply follow it.</p>
<p>In the essay by Peter J. Bentley and Una-May O’Reilly they talk about what goes into the making of an evolutionary medium and what are the obstacles involved. But I am not in compliant with Step 7, software telling about how good and bad your building is aesthetically and learning from your inputs. Somehow it doesn’t seem right, you can have software telling you how climatically or energy efficient it is but how appealing it is? As an Architect I cant just agree with that. But I am completely in agreement with the importance of developing medium for specific purposes and as small important steps and parts rather than a whole thing together. This firstly would be easier to incorporate in a medium you are already working on and secondly it would be easier switch if found to be competent enough to do your work with.</p>

    <p>In my opinion I agree with the position of Tapesofwrath where noted in the CEDS document: "Our designers CEDS should keep doing what they are at best: design. We must not become computer scientists." One way is by adding and limitations provided as this only limits the artist and not allowed to grow in most relevant aspects when designing</p>
