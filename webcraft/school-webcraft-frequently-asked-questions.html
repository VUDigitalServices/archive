Check out the P2PU Frequently Asked Quesions page <a href="http://p2pu.org/faqs" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h3>

<h3>
	<strong>How can I get involved in the School of Webcraft? </strong></h3>
<p>
	<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEdtSFFDeUM3MzBVTzhBd2E4anRwU0E6MQ" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">Propose a course</a>, <a href="https://www.drumbeat.org/webcraft/sign-up" rel="nofollow">take a course</a>, or contribute ideas by <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/p2pu-webcraft" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">joining our community</a>. P2PU <a href="http://pad.p2pu.org/community" rel="nofollow">Community Calls</a> are also open to all wishing to attend and we discuss Webcraft business on these calls. You can also <a href="https://donate.mozilla.org/page/contribute/webcraft" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">make a donation</a> to support the School of Webcraft&#39;s work.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>What do you mean by &quot;webcraft?&quot;</strong></h3>
<p>
	Webcraft is &quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/owea/wiki/Web_Craft" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">a systematic approach to web development and design education</a>.&quot; We think of it as as the range of skills, knowledge and habits today&#39;s web developers and designers need to be successful, creative and current.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How do School of Webcraft courses work? Where do they meet?</strong></h3>
<p>
	School of Webcraft classes are organised online and can be as short&nbsp; as one week. Anyone, anywhere with access to the web is free to apply for a course. Some courses hold online meetings or presentations each week. Other courses run asynchronously, and rely entirely on email and forum communication instead of online meetings.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How much does it cost to take a course?</strong></h3>
<p>
	Nothing. School of Webcraft courses are 100% free.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>I&#39;d like to take a School of Webcraft course. How do I do that?</strong></h3>
<p>
	Visit our <a href="https://www.drumbeat.org/webcraft/sign-up" rel="nofollow">course registration page</a> to apply for a class. Course registration typically opens two or three weeks before the start of classes. Please note that because demand for coures is high, we can&#39;t guarantee that all applicants will be accepted into a course.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>I&#39;d like to lead a School of Webcraft course. How do I do that?</strong></h3>
<p>
	You can propose a School of Webcraft course through our course proposal form <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEdtSFFDeUM3MzBVTzhBd2E4anRwU0E6MQ" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You can also have a look at P2PU&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/w/page/27905271/Course-Design-Handbook" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">Course Design Handbook</a>&quot; for tips and guidlines on designing your course.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>I&#39;d like to suggest a course idea, but not necessarily organise it myself. Can I do that?</strong></h3>
<p>
	Sure! Suggest your course idea using P2PU&#39;s <a href="http://p2pu.uservoice.com/forums/84091-course-suggestions" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"><span>UserVoice forum</span></a>. You can also vote on other people&#39;s course suggestions there.</p>
<h3 id="magicdomid47">
	<span class="b">I&#39;ve got something I want to learn, but it&#39;s quite simple. Can I still participate?</span></h3>
<div id="magicdomid48">
	<span>Totally! We&#39;re happy for you to commit&nbsp; for as little as one week or to connect some related modules together to create a longer learning project. You may want to take responsibility for organising only the first week&#39;s plan of activities and resources and invite other learners to develop plans for subsequent weeks. </span></div>
<h3>
	<strong>Do I need to be an expert to lead a course?</strong></h3>
<p>
	You don&#39;t need to be a world-leading expert on your topic. While it certainly helps to have some background knowledge about the course you organise, the most important thing is to be committed to sharing your learning experience with other passionate people.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How much of a time commitment is typically involved in running a course?</strong></h3>
<p>
	Leading a School of Webcraft course typically takes up to about three hours a week, over six to ten weeks. A lot of the day-to-day time commitment stems from answering emails from participants and moderating discussions. Course organisers should also plan on setting aside some time before the course starts to design their course, structure the schedule, gather resources and gather feedback from the community.</p>
<h3 id="magicdomid35">
	<span class="b">What can I learn at School of Webcraft?</span></h3>
<div id="magicdomid36">
	<span>School of Webcraft has been established to help people learn open and standards based web development skills and theory. This means that topics can range from the basics of creating a first site and learning to develop correct, semantically marked up code for HTML, CSS and JavaScript all the way through to best practice for complex web applications using databases and languages such as PHP, Python / Django or Ruby on Rails.</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid37">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div id="magicdomid38">
	<span>This April we&#39;re actively looking for people to lead projects focussed on beginner skills and front end development, particularly new features within HTML5 and CSS3, but you&#39;re welcome to propose any idea that doesn&#39;t rely on proprietary technologies.</span></div>
<h3>
	<strong>What courses has the School of Webcraft offered so far?</strong></h3>
<p>
	We&#39;ve offered a number of courses from web development basics through to dynamic site development with Python and PHP.&nbsp; You can browse through <a href="http://p2pu.org/webcraft/course/list?course_status[20_running]=20_running&amp;course_status[30_complete]=30_complete&amp;course_status[40_archived]=40_archived&amp;title=&amp;tid[307]=307" rel="nofollow">past courses</a> on the P2PU site.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>I&#39;d like to teach or learn in a language other than English. How can I do that?</strong></h3>
<p>
	The School of Webcraft is dedicated to providing courses in as many languages as possible. Last semester we ran courses in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/p2pu-portugues" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">Portuguese</a> and are looking to expand to include <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/p2pu-espanol" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">Spanish</a> and other languages from January 2011 on. Please propose your course through our <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEdtSFFDeUM3MzBVTzhBd2E4anRwU0E6MQ" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">course proposal form</a>.</p>
<h3 id="magicdomid41">
	<span class="b"><b>I&#39;d love to get involved but I&#39;ve got limited time. Can I set my own schedule?</b></span></h3>
<p>
	<span>That&#39;s no problem, participants can organise a project whenever is convenient for them, so you&#39;re welcome to create a project idea and set the start and end dates to suit your schedule. We organise four main cycles a year which coincide with our <a href="http://p2pu.org/general/course-design-orientation " rel="nofollow">Organisers&#39; Orientation</a>. If you can&#39;t participate in the Orientation we recommend that you read through our <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/Course-Design-Handbook" rel="nofollow">Handbook</a> and let us know of any questions you&#39;d like answered.</span></p>
<h3>
	<strong>Do you offer accreditation for School of Webcraft courses? Like a diploma or certificate?</strong></h3>
<p>
	Not yet. But we are developing an accreditation system based on <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/content/badges-show-your-awesome-skills" rel="nofollow">badges</a>. These badges will help learners publicise their achievement and skills to outside stakeholders, like potential employers.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>I have a question that&#39;s not covered here. How can I get in touch with someone about it?</strong></h3>
<p>
	The best way to find something out is to ask in our <a href="http://qa.p2pu.org" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">question and answer forum</a>.</p>
