    <p>My Background:</p>
<p>I've been using Drupal as an end-user for a number of years. Working in an arts organization, where we had more elbow grease than money it saved me time for having to manage many project sites, and facilitated collaboration between project participants. </p>
<p>I was pulled into more involvement in the community when I went to my first meet-up, and have been active ever since. I'm so glad it's a central part of my work-life now. </p>
<p>I am also familiar with Wordpress, and a novice in Joomla as well. </p>
<p>My personal goals:</p>
<p>My goals for this participating in this course is to work with new Drupal users to make a good welcome wagon for Drupal, and ensure people get to see the "major sights" on their initial tour of Drupal and the community. </p>
<p>I'm also keen to participate in growing P2PU, because I really think this is a great project.</p>

    <p>Hi folks, I've been a graphic designer for more years than i like to admit, and designed my first websites in the late 90s for the Intl. Trade Centre and some small subsites for WHO in Geneva, Switzerland. Never found the time/patience to learn to code, so normally work with developers. MarilynsView on Drupal Gardens and Twitter.</p>
<p>I've designed sites that use good-old HTML, Cold Fusion, Python/Django, Wordpress, before Drupal. Felt right at home when I found the Drupal community. Just got back from the DC Drupal meetup this evening. Looking forward to meeting you all and learning together.</p>
<p>Goals? There's always lots to learn. I'd like to learn a little about using command-line, Drush/Aegir if that's possible. Love learning, so it should all work for me.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Heather and to Web Enabled for putting this together.</p>

    <p>I learned HTML and wrote my first web page in 1996.  Since then, I have managed a few web sites as a hobby and as a volunteer, picking up some CSS, Javascript, and PHP along the way.  Two or three years ago, I decided that a CMS would be the right way to move forward, and Drupal seemed like the best choice.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get started, but I now run two sites in Drupal (one for my 25'th college reunion, earlier this year, and one for my Boy Scout troop) and am developing a third.  There is a lot to learn, and I hope this course will teach me where to look for help and find answers.  It will be nice if I can finish that third site at the same time. ;)</p>

    <p>Hi everyone,<br />
My background is in accounting and finance systems consulting.  My IT skills are self taught over the years.  I've worked with HTML a bit, and to a minor degree with CSS.  I guess I will be learning more CSS shortly.  </p>
<p>I like to understand why things work the way they do.  I am not a developer or a themer, but I need to learn more about those two areas to make my Drupal sites work the way I need them to.  Once you understand how it works, Drupal appears to be highly configurable.  I look forward to understanding views/panels and theming better.</p>

    <p>Hello to all,</p>
<p>I'm Portuguese and start playing with drupal some months ago (i used it for developing a small site), and i'm impressed with it, the community is growing and is amazing.</p>
<p>My background is in web development and support, currently i work with one commercial big cms (vignette), that fact, gives me the understanding of dificulties with commercial software (closed apis, bad documentation, legal restrictions, etc.), in opposition of that, Drupal is a big step, it means freedom for the developer, and no restrictions for the designer.</p>
<p>My contact with Drupal was mostly self-learning, so with this course, i hope to re-learn some basic and core aspects.</p>

    <p>Hi everybody. I'm a designer from London who works on web and print projects and administer two Drupal sites. English is my second language. First half of my life I lived in Russia.</p>
<p>I have no programming background at all - my HTML is very basic. I would like to learn enough Drupal to be able to put sites together myself. </p>
<p>Many thanks to everyone involved in making this course happen. I think it's a great opportunity for people like myself to learn faster and easier.</p>

    <p>Thanks everyone for introducing yourselves! Please check out people's introductions. Do you see someone who has a similar background or interest area? Do you see someone who looks to be at about your same experience level? </p>
<p>Tomorrow, Wednesday we'll have our first online session as a Welcome to the course. You can meet some other folks there too. I'll be sending out the login details today via email. </p>
<p>@ Emily - I think it's often the way people start- Drupal starts as a hobby for people. My friend, Stella Power, was working as a software engineer, and only used Drupal for her photography site. Now she's full time on Drupal, and much happier. You can see her company here: <a href="http://annertech.com" title="http://annertech.com" rel="nofollow">http://annertech.com</a> - Stella also maintains some popular Drupal modules too.</p>
<p>@ Iqbal - I'm coming from the other direction. I know more about Drupal, but recently started to learn more about Joomla, I hope we can find a common language together. </p>
<p>@ Conrado Nao mi diga! OK, that is the limit of my Portuguese, but welcome to the course. Do you have previous web development experience?</p>
<p>@ Marilyn! Heya :) We know each other from <a href="http://DrupalGardens.com" title="http://DrupalGardens.com" rel="nofollow">http://DrupalGardens.com</a> - and of course I met you from the Drupalcon in San Fran. So glad you can join this course. I think you have quite a bit of experience already. </p>
<p>@ Benji - looks like you have quite a bit of experience. You might find this course is a bit basic for you, but I think there might be some topics you can benefit from. I hope you can stick with it, you might also find that by helping others you're learning a lot. Do you participate in documentation or a local community group yet?</p>
<p>@ EM - We will certainly be touching on Views and panels. We'll also be touching on theming. </p>
<p>@ Jenny-Anne - Cool! Are you using the DAMP stack locally? That can make it easy to set up a local working environment. </p>
<p>@ Paulo Looks like Conrado also speaks Portuguese :) It's great you bring experience with Vignette. I have never used it myself. I look forward to hearing how they differ. </p>
<p>@ Julia - Because you have less experience with Web development, there might be some big picture questions you have about making the best of the web for your projects. Don't hesitate to ask!</p>

    <p>It's a bit overwhelming starting something from scratch. After looking closer at the syllabus I was taken aback - most of the tasks are to advanced for me to try out. But the great thing is to see a set of starting points. At the end of the course I should have a clear picture of CMA capabilities in Drupal.</p>

<p>@ Heather:  Looking at the syllabus, I see several things that look familiar, but several that should be very helpful.  I hope to contribute to documentation or in other ways, but have not done so yet.  The first time I went to a meetup was last week, at MIT.  I got some useful advice, and you may recall that I bristled at being called a "complete newbie."  (I think of myself as an advanced newbie. ;)</p>

    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My background includes developing php/mysql web applications from scratch without any CMS/frameworks but now want to learn and use Drupal and some frameworks to get web apps developed quicker and with better security.  I have been using Drupal for a number of months (using drush too).  But feel I missing bits to make it all "click" together.  I am lacking on the design side, I do understand html/css well but lack the experience of best practice page structure so I would like to learn how to build themes properly and how they work with views. Other areas I would like to learn about: know more aegir, jQuery.  Based on Dublin, Ireland.</p>

    <p>Hi</p>
<p>My work focuses around the broad area of Knowledge and Information Services for companies and organizations. This is often thought of as a 3-pronged process of people &gt; processes &gt; technology. In addition to business research and analysis, Knowledge Services involves capturing a firm's tacit knowledge, documenting best practices, and designing applications such as Intranets, Knowledge Bases, and websites that pull it all together for easy access. I've developed a couple of websites focusing on the content and info. architecture.<br />
As for Drupal - jumped into it a couple of months ago when the website of my favorite nonprofit crashed. Began at square #1 duplicating the site, slowly grasped Drupal's foundations, but significant gaps are escaping me. Drupal (utilizing it's more robust functions) offers this nonprofit (and others in the pipeline) tremendous potential to develop and grow a broader community and be a significant resource. It's completely up to me. After working alone, I'm thrilled (and relieved)to be focusing on this structured Drupal instruction as well as joining with this larger corps of Drupal fans.<br />
I'm based in Cambridge/Boston.</p>

<p>I'm very strong in ExpressionEngine, but know little of Drupal and other CMS's. I'd like to broaden my expertise in Drupal especially.</p>
<p>In addition to EE, I'm a very competent xHTML/CSS guy, love jQuery and just plain ol' JS, and learning how to get stuff done in Rails.</p>

    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I run a small nonprofit website that features aggregated video from nonprofit organizations.  We're migrating to OpenPublish soon, so I'd like to be as helpful as I can in designing and maintaining the new site.</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of experience either designing or building websites, but I have taken one Drupal course and have been reading up about planning Drupal sites, so that's a start.</p>
<p>Look forward to diving into the coursework and learning as much as I can.  Thanks for the opportunity!</p>

    <p>Wow! We have such an interesting mix of people. I originally thought we'd restrict sign ups. That is, only select people who fit a certain profile: someone with a little web experience, but no experience with Drupal. However, you all have such a great range, and yet, I do think you'll both be able to contribute something and get something from this course. </p>
<p>I look forward to seeing this develop :)</p>
<p>@ John Warde! Heya! You're in Ireland too! Do you go to the Dublin meet-ups? I live in Sligo, but I really want to find a way to get to the Dublin meet-ups more often. See: <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/ireland" title="http://groups.drupal.org/ireland" rel="nofollow">http://groups.drupal.org/ireland</a> I'm trying to think if I met you before at any of the Camps? Sorry if I am spacing on meeting you. </p>
<p>@ Paula Cohen  - I'd really love your input into organizing the knowledge sharing in this course here. I worked on our internal KB for Acquia. I think you're going to love the powers of taxonomy and modules like "Community tagging". There are some distributions you will like too. </p>
<p>@ Mason - It's great you have that design experience. We really need more designers in Drupal. There is so much commercial work available for people with your experience. I think you'll be critical of the UI coming from EE, but if you're interested, you can work on communicating this back to developers and really have a powerful effect on Drupal. Please check out: <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/design-drupal" title="http://groups.drupal.org/design-drupal" rel="nofollow">http://groups.drupal.org/design-drupal</a> We can also point you to some good admin themes and tools to make the back end UI more lovely. </p>
<p>@ Wendy - You have a great mix of skills. I think you'll find Drupal is a useful framework, and useful addition to your tool kit. </p>
<p>@ Tom - I'm exactly the same. I consider myself CMS agnostic, and love to try new things. </p>
<p>@ Marilyn, maybe I should see if Alex will be able to come to a session. I could also see if Adrian (daddy of Aegir) could pop in at some point. I forgot you get to go to the DC meet-ups!</p>
<p>@ Kasper -  this course might be a bit basic for you, but I'd love if there were ways we could keep you interested in attending, as you might be able to share some insights from your mobile dev experience. </p>
<p>@ Kristen - Oh cool, Open Publish as an excellent tool. It's always good to have your own little side projec and sandbox, it doesn't even have to be  "live". This will give you a better sense of the potential of Drupal, and let you feel more comfortable.</p>

    <p>@Heather First, sorry to miss yesterday's orientation. I'm on vacation as of today, so yesterday was impossibly busy at work. I'm hoping to make the next Wednesday meeting, if we've returned by then (there's a chance I'll still be in transit).</p>
<p>Re inviting Alex, Adrian: why not? I've asked Alex about presenting the a new DC Drupal training meetup. Another idea would be for him to work with us here, and make that presentation available to the other group. Or once you've evaluated this class, making it known to that group (which I would do anyway).</p>

I run my own website languagereef.com which is used to teach Indian languages and in the future for other foreign languages too..<br />
I want to learn drupal to see if I can use drupal for my website for course management. Had worked with joomla at the basic level but have not tried drupal yet.. So it would be a wonderful oppurtunity to learn drupal. Thanks again.</p>

    <p>Hello World!</p>
<p>I'm glad to have found the class.</p>
<p>I have experience with Joomla! and a bit of Wordpress.  I've also built in Magento and experimented at a lot of special purpose web apps; however I'm happy to be now working with Drupal, the swiss army knife of CMS.</p>
<p>I've been playing with D7 under MAMP and have 1.5 D6 sites on up.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to talking shop with others and building two more Drupal/CiviCRM sites this year.</p>
<p>Eventually, I will become a full time Drupal dev.</p>

    <p>Hi everybody, I'm starting a little bit late.</p>
<p>I don't have any experience at all with Drupal.  But, I hope to get up to speed quickly.  I do have experience in HTML CSS, and a little bit of javascript and PHP.  I've worked with Wordpress and vBulletin before as well as far as CMS type software goes.</p>
<p>I simply hope to become familiar enough with all open source CMSs that I can comfortably pick the right one for whatever particular project and customize it accordingly.  And, Drupal is on that list of course.</p>

    <p>Hello, All. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to learn here and, fingers crossed, my employer will be supportive. I am in the process of getting them to OK the time necessary for the online sessions so cross your fingers for me.</p>
<p>I have just a small touch of experience with Drupal. I had built a site that served primarily as my blog space with a few fun modules (weather, GPS location, etc.) but, it was hacked and converted to a porn link joint. So, I killed it dead and want to learn more about Drupal before going live again. I am also in the process of roughing up a site for our home based haunted house that we do each year and will be using some of what we learn to make it all it can be. </p>
<p>Looking forward to the sessions,</p>

    <p>Hello All!  I've been a project manager and producer for 20+ years.  I've designed and managed a wide range of custom web solutions (LAMP); however, I have generally always had a team of developers involved.  I am looking forward to becoming more self-sufficient and better able to manage large Drupal projects.  Over the course of the last year, I have become more and more involved with the Drupal community both locally, in the Seattle and Boston areas, and internationally as we explore opportunities to collaborate and improve education globally.</p>

    <p>Hi, self-taught HTML/CSS &amp; some Javascript, done a couple of sites. Some WordPress, very conversant with Blogger if that counts. Heard a lot of people extolling the virtues of Drupal so I'd like to learn it.</p>
<p>Am also very keen on the self-study aspect as for an internet course with differing time zones for students it won't always be easy to attend live sessions, especially if they are during my work hours, so being able to catch up with recordings later and self-study would be perfect. And the ability to ask questions in the forums that one can't ask live because of having to miss a live session.</p>

    <p>*  What's your background with web development or CMSs?<br />
I have coded a few websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch and consider myself an advanced beginner on these topics.  Drupal was used in many of my classes at school to manage assignments.  I run my blog on Wordpress and have a portfolio site that runs on the Cargo Collective's system.  </p>
<p>* What are your personal goals for this course?<br />
In my classes at school, Drupal always seemed a little clunky and difficult for the administrators to bend to their will. The Drupal community is huge though, so this tool must be powerful and worthwhile.  I'm eager for guidance on what Drupal is good for and how to upgrade my skills past level of end user of a CMS someone else set up.</p>

    <p>Hi all,<br />
I missed the first week on the course. Became aware of it only through linked in and Heathers comment in the Drupal Users group this morning. (And am so glad I am now aware of it).</p>
<p>I have been a web developer for some years working on web applications on Java, javascript.<br />
Just recently started on community website using Drupal. So learning PHP concurrently as well. As with many Drupal newbies, I have been struggling with the right approach to get a good and deep understanding of Drupal.<br />
I am hoping we can learn many things about Drupal together..</p>

    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I have no experience with web development or CMSs. However, I did work at Liberty Mutual in the past as a Business Analyst and did work with developers on a daily basis. I learned enough about that particular system to be dangerous.</p>
<p>My goal for this course is to understand the basics of Drupal. I am currently in training as a project manager for a friend's web development company. Knowing as much as possible about Drupal will benefit me while working with our clients and developers. </p>

    <p>About Me</p>
<p>I am working on the side as a Drupal developer, gradually increasing my skill level so I can fly on my own.  I originally started with Microsoft VB.Net and did not like the atmosphere of the programmers or the marketing aims.  I switched to open-source as a vehicle for bringing my ideas for other people's websites to fruition because I embrace the principles and atmosphere of the open-source community. Drupal, in particular, is a fun - interactive - exciting - intelligent - growing community that I am grateful to be a part of. I practice qigong, embrace permaculture, ride my bicycle almost everywhere and am always learning and growing in ways I never thought I would or could.</p>
<p>I have some experience with Drupal under my belt but always consider myself new and seek to reinforce everything I think I know with all the new learning opportunities as they present themselves. Thank you for this course.</p>

    <p>Hi, I'm Topher.  I've been a php coder for about 12 years now, and need to get up to speed with Drupal.  I signed up for this class about a week ago, but never got any confirmation or instructions.  Then the other day I got about 25 emails from people talking about a webinar, things they'd done for the class etc.</p>
<p>I take it the class has started?  I've sent some emails to <a href="mailto:admin@p2pu.org" rel="nofollow">admin@p2pu.org</a> but there's no response.  Is someone leading the class?  What should be my next step?</p>

<p>@ Topher - Hello ! There was a two step application process which fell apart sort of. There was a problem with the mail server at p2pu- so many emails got queued up and sent all at once.I recommend you fix your own notification settings, and limit what you get. It wasn't my intention to deluge people.<br />
Please see instructions on fixing notifications.<br />

After that, do the activities for Week 1.</p>
<p>Glad you could join us. You haven't missed much, we're just getting introduced here, and getting an idea of what this course is.</p>
<p>@ James R. Stone - heya! glad you can join us. Some of this may seem very basic to you, but you might enjoy being able to help others.</p>
<p>@ Erin - good thing is you work in a web dev company- and I'm sure you can absorb things quickly. Without web development experience many of these things may seem a challenge.Please read my document on How to Learn Drupal:<br />

    <p>Thanks Heather for the opportunity to be a part of your teaching/sharing experience!  I really support the learning experiences that are cropping up in the Drupal community; there is a lot of knowledge that remains relatively untapped if you are a "newbie" or an extremely shy person. It is really helping me cement some minor gaps in my self-learning process. This was also the first podcast I have listened to from Doug Vann and I thought it was very information packed, clear and easy to follow.</p>

    <p>Hello World!</p>
<p>I'm  FLOSS fanboy although I still use OS X and run Win in Virtualbox.</p>
<p>I came across CMS after being limited in propriety e-commerce site.   </p>
<p>I have a lot of Joomla! experience, and some Wordpress and have been active in the Toronto meetup groups.</p>
<p>Looked at a lot of apps/platforms that where best in breed but more recently "drank the Drupal kook-aid".</p>
<p>I love the modular approach that lets you do so much with the same backend and "eat your own dog food".   </p>
<p>This year I will explore CiviCRM and Open Atrium for two non-profits I'm involved with, network with folks like yourselves and mind map the hell out of Drupal.</p>

    <p>Hi Heather,<br />
I have registered the Intro Drupal course, but was away last week. Sorry.<br />
I based in Dublin, in NovaUCD, UCD, and have over two decades of software engineering experience from UK,Europe, US and Asia, and of course, in Ireland.<br />
I'm a software developer and run a commercial enterprise in this industry with a number of specialised sectors to include eLearning with strong business experience and interest in Ireland / UK &amp; EU with Asia / China, HKSAR, Japan.<br />
I used the like of Moodle and like to find out what's under the hood of Drupal and learn from others from their experience.<br />
Thx &amp; rgds.</p>

    <p>@ Jason - great to have you here! Sounds like you have plenty of experience to share. Thanks for joining us. </p>
<p>@ Kraken Yu - I hope you come to the Drupal Ireland Camp in Dublin, Nov 20-21st.<br />
<a href="http://www.drupalcampireland.org/" title="http://www.drupalcampireland.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drupalcampireland.org/</a></p>
<p>@ Julio &amp; Swaroop- great to hear. Wordpress is an excellent tool. I know Drupal has some room to improve in the UX/UI design, so I'm glad you can bring your point of view. </p>
<p>@Harinee  - it's too bad coding isn't like riding a bike! It's hard to remember. But hopefully you'll learn quickly. </p>
<p>@ Devesh, Mino - good to see you're into self-study. </p>
<p>@  Marwan - a law degree! That is impressive. One of my colleagues, who is a talented Drupalist was previously a physicist. I guess coding was more fun for him.</p>
