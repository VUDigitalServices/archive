<div class="ace-line" id="magicdomid356">
	<span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">Welcome&nbsp; to our second class in the &quot;UX Design&quot; course at P2PU. Last class we&nbsp; talked about the philosophycal and historical origins of the field, as&nbsp; well as some areas where Design can be applied. We named them&nbsp; &quot;Specializations&quot;. We also observed that most of them use the same tools to generate </span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn">outcomes</span><span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">, on many different supportings.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid181">
	<span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">As&nbsp; course organizers, we were specially interested by the various&nbsp; different definitions given to &quot;Digital Design&quot; - being it the platform,&nbsp; the end product, the method... Now, as we move forward, we&#39;re going to get deeper into specifics: What</span><span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj i"><i> is</i></span><span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj"> interaction, after all?</span></div>

<div class="ace-line" id="magicdomid357">
	<span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">Let&#39;s try to decompose the word: Inter + Action. The first part, &quot;Inter&quot;, semantically represents </span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn">a bound/relation between &quot;things&quot; (in any direction) </span><span class="author-g-3d6gepcnqt1xfhjl">, as for instance the words &quot;</span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn">International</span><span class="author-g-3d6gepcnqt1xfhjl">&quot;</span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn"> (between nations), </span><span class="author-g-3d6gepcnqt1xfhjl">&quot;I</span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn">nterdiscipline</span><span class="author-g-3d6gepcnqt1xfhjl">&quot;</span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn"> (between disciplines)</span><span class="author-g-3d6gepcnqt1xfhjl">, and so on. </span><span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">The other part, &quot;Action&quot;, represents the motion of this relation. According to this point of view, we could say that &quot;to interact&quot; is to have an input-output relation between vectors or agents.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid185">
	<span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">Once again we&#39;re faced with different definitions for the same term. It happens especially because of the highly subjective level of the concept. Differently from Math, which is purely objective, the Design vocabulary is full of multi-sided interpretations. </span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn">Are </span><span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">t</span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn">here </span><span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">d</span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn">ifferent </span><span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">t</span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn">ypes</span><span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj"> of Interaction</span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn">s</span><span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">?

	<span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">As we talk about Digital Design, the term Human-computer interaction (HCI) comes to our mind. Nicky Danino exposes three main objectives for this area: understand, develop, achieve. We recommend you to read his article at SitePoint [2].</span></div>

<div id="magicdomid189">
	<span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">Keeping the same train of thought, interaction only exists because of the social nature of the human being. We are dependent of others of our kind; living in society complements our instincts, and, in the modern world, drives most of our decisions and lives. Being society fair or unfair, we will still need assistence to develop ourselves.</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid190">
	<span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">These social factors are represented by emotions. Subjetive, deeply intense emotions - sometimes externalized (output) or kept to ourselves (input).</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid191">
	<span class="author-g-lfnrrz122z2eoyxgvwlj">As Designers, we have the tools to simulate and stimulate emotions, via aesthetics, tactile sensations, sound and much more. We are, then, able to propose experiences.</span><span class="author-g-4t3dwm4bgojuhaqn"> But in order to create great experiences, as designers we must know, at least, the basic facts about cognitive psychology. As we said in our first class, you are designing for people; you need to be well versed in the abilities and frailties of the human mind [3][4][5].&nbsp;</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid192">

<p>W2 | Interação<br />
Bem-vindo(a) à nossa segunda aula do curso "UX Design" na P2PU. Na última semana conversamos sobre as origens filosóficas e históricas do campo, assim como algumas áreas onde o Design pode ser aplicado. Demos a estas áreas o nome de "Especializações". Também observamos que a maioria delas utiliza as mesmas ferramentas para gerar diferentes artefatos, em vários diferentes suportes.<br />
Como organizadores do curso, nos interessamos especialmente pelas diferentes definições dadas a Design Digital - sendo a plataforma, o produto final, o método…<br />
Agora, ao avançarmos, vamos iniciar tópicos mais específicos: O que é interação, afinal?</p>
<p>W2 | Interação humano-computador<br />
Vamos tentar decompor a palavra: Inter + Ação. A primeira parte, "Inter", representa semanticamente um laço/relação entre ˜coisas" (em qualquer direção), como por exemplo as palavras "Internacional" (entre nações), "Interdisciplinar" (entre disciplinas), e assim por diante. A outra parte, "Ação", representa o movimento desta relação. De acordo com este ponto de vista, podemos afirmar que "interagir" é ter uma relação de entrada-saída entre vetores ou agentes.<br />
Novamente nos deparamos com diferentes definições para o mesmo termo. Isso ocorre principalmente devido ao fato de este ser um conceito muito abstrato. Diferentemente da Matemática, que é puramente objetiva, o vocabulário do Design é repleto de interpretações multi-laterais. Há diferentes tipos de interação? [1]</p>
<p>W2 | Sociabilidade e emoção<br />
Mantendo a linha de raciocínio, a interação só existe por conta da natureza social do ser humano. Somos dependentes uns dos outros; viver em sociedade complementa nossos instintos, e, no mundo moderno, define muitas de nossas decisões de vida. Seja a sociedade justa ou cruel, ainda precisamos de assitência para nos desenvolvermos.<br />
Estes fatores sociais são representados por emoções - subjetivas e profundamente intensas; às vezes externadas ou mantidas para nós mesmos.<br />
Como Designers, temos as ferramentas para simular e estimular emoções, por meios estéticos, tácteis, sons, e muito mais. Somos, então, capazes de propiciar experiências. Mas para podermos criar grandes experiências, devemos saber ao menos fatos básicos de psicologia cognitiva. Como comentado na primeira semana, vocês projetam para pessoas; vocês precisam estar cientes das fraquezas e fortalezas da mente humana [3] [4].<br />
Como complemento para este tópico, recomendamos a leitura do artigo "Design Emocional" de Don Norman (em inglês) [5] e a coleção de vídeos de Tedde Van Gelderen sobre Design de Experiência [6][7].</p>
<p>W2 | Design de interação<br />
Uma fonte valiosa de informação sobre Design de Interação é a IxD Library [8].</p>
<p>W2 | Atividade<br />
Escolha um artigo da IxD Library e comente sobre ele - coisas com as quais você concorda, discorda… Como já aprendemos os conceitos básicos de Design, chegou a hora de sermos críticos. Defenda seu ponto de vista.</p>

<p>S2 | Interacción<br />
Bienvenidos a nuestra secunda clase del curso de "Diseño de Experiencia de Usuario" en P2PU. En la primera clase nos referimos a los orígenes filosóficos e histórcos del campo, así como también a áreas en donde se aplica el diseño. Nos referimos a ellas como "especializaciones". También observamos que la mayoría de ellas utilizan las mismas herramientas o enfoques para generar resultados, en diferentes plataformas.<br />
Estamos especialmente interesados en las diferentes definiciones brindadas por ustedes acerca de "Diseño Digital" - siendo éste la plataforma, el producto final, el método...<br />
Ahora, mientras avanzamos, vamos a interiorizarnos en aspectos específicos: Qué es la  interacción, después de todo?</p>
<p>S2 | Interacción Humano-Máquina o Interacción Humano-Ordenador<br />
Intentemos descomponer la palabra: Inter + acción. La primera parte, "Inter" representa semánticamente un lazo/relación entre "cosas" (en cualquier dirección), por ejemplo las palabras "Internacional" (entre naciones), "Interdisciplina" (entre disciplinas), etc. "Acción" representa al movimiento en esta relación. De acuerdo a este punto de vista, podemos decir , a grandes rasgos, que "interactuar" es tener una relación de entrada-salida entre agentes.<br />
Una vez más, nos enfrentamos a diferentes definiciones del mismo término. Esto sucede especialmente debido al nivel altamente subjetivo del concepto. Diferente de las Matemáticas, la cual es puramente objetiva, el vocabulario relacionado al Diseño está colmado de diferentes interpretaciones. Existen diferentes tipos de interacciones? [1]<br />
Mientras hablamos de Diseño Digital, el término Interacción-Humano-Máquina o Interacción Humano-Ordenador viene a nuestra mente. Nicky Danino expone tres objetivos principales para ésta area: entender, desarrollar, alcanzar. Recomendamos leas este artículo en SitePoint [2]</p>
<p>S2 | Sociabilidad y emoción<br />
Siguiendo en la misma línea de pensamiento, la interacción sólo existe debido a la naturaleza social del ser humano. Dependemos mutuamente de nuestra especie; vivir en sociedad complementa nuestros instintos, y, en el mundo moderno, direccionan la mayoría de nuestras decisiones y vidas. Incluso en una sociedad es injusta, necesitamos asistencia para desarrollarnos.<br />
Estos factores sociales son representados por las emociones. Emociones subjetivas y profundamente intensas - ciertas veces externalizadas (como salida) o internalizadas (como entrada).<br />
Como diseñadores, contamos con las herramientas para simular y estimular emociones, estéticamente, a través de sensaciones táctiles, sonido y mucho más. Somo, entonces, responsables de proponer experiencias. Pero para poder crear excelentes experiencias, como diseñadores debemos conocer, al menos, los aspectos o hechos básicos acerca de la psicología cognitiva. Como dijimos en nuestra primera clase, diseñamos para la gente; necesitas estar seguro acerca de las habilidades y fragilidades de la mente humana [3][4].<br />
Como complemento a este tema, recomendamos el material de Don Norman acerca de "Diseño Emocional" [5] y la colección de videos de Tedde Van Gelderen acerca de Diseño de Experiencia. [6]</p>
<p>S2 | Diseñando para interacción<br />
Una fuente de información muy valiosa para el Diseño de Interacción es la Librería de IxD (IxD= Diseño de Interacción en inglés) [7]. </p>
<p>S2 | Actividad<br />
Selecciona un artículo de la Librería de Diseño de Interacción y cuéntanos acerca de el mismo - con qué aspectos estás de acuerdo, en cuáles no, qué agregarías... Como ya vimos las fronteras del campo del Diseño, es tu turno de ser crítico. Defiende tu punto de vista.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I'd like to share my running commentary on the article "Controls are Choices" by Dan Saffer. (<a href="http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/controls-are-choices/" title="http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/controls-are-choices/" rel="nofollow">http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/controls-are-choices/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>"The physical characteristics of a control, what interaction designers call affordances, dictate what can be done with it. A button affords pressing, for instance."</strong><br />
This reminds me of an article about UI by Joel Spolsky. [1]  And both Saffer and Spolsky seem to be referring to the term affordance as used by Don Norman in his book "The Psychology of Everyday Things". Norman clarifies the use of the term, thus: "The real question is about the perceived affordance: Does the user perceive that clicking on that location is a meaningful, useful action to perform?" [2]<br />
I think what Norman means here is that it's not enough to make controls look like you can do something with them. The control should look like it can do something that you want, in order to get to your goal, be it looking up a phone number, signing up for a newsletter, or baking bread.</p>
<p><strong>"Reducing complexity means reducing control, and some users, particularly those whose skill goes beyond that of amateur/beginner, don’t just want control, they need it to perform their tasks effectively. Thus, it becomes a balancing act, with simplicity and automation on one side, and complexity and control on the other."</strong><br />
In the book "Simple and Usable", Giles Colborne says there are three types of users: experts, willing adopters, and mainstreamers. Mainstreamers make up the majority of a population of users. Expert users, says Colborne, can be ignored because "they aren't typical customers, and their judgment is often skewed....If you listen to them first, you'll create products that are too complex for mainstream customers to use."[3]<br />
While I don't necessarily agree that the "expert minority" should be ignored, what I can get from Saffer and Colborne is that identifying the market you are designing for should drive how much control you can and should give your users. Are you designing for a small group who want maximum control (ex. commercial grade espresso machines)? Or does your target user expect the product to do one thing well, without much effort (ex. iPod, Flip cam)?<br />
Or to use another analogy, are you designing a car for Batman, or the everyman?</p>
<p><strong>"The best controls have three characteristics: an affordance to let the user know the control is there; an indication (often a label) of what the control controls; and feedback to let the user know the control has been used."</strong><br />
Someone I know who has a touch-screen mobile phone once confided that he had a hard time typing with the virtual keypad. "It's hard to tell which button I'm pressing unless I look intently at the screen," he says.<br />
I own a numeric-keypad phone. I value the fact that I can tell, with high accuracy, which key my thumb is on (the "5" key has a ridge on it, so the key above the ridge is "2", the key below is "8", etc.). Sure, it does take a little longer to type out long messages, but when I think about it, both a virtual and real keypad are well-labelled (indication); but a real keypad has raised keys and ridges (affordance); and the keys sink down when you press them (feedback). I think these features map better to my mental model [4] of "typing letters using a keypad". In the past, I have experienced using a typewriter, and then a desktop keyboard, and so my expectation of alphabet/number keys is that, when they are not pressed, they are raised above the surface of the keypad. When they are pressed, they don't change color. They sink below the surface and even make little clicky sounds.<br />
So if mobile phone makers ever decide to phase out real keypads, I think my mobile user experience would be, for lack of better terms, totally screwed. :)</p>

    <p>Gostei do artigo <b><i>Explicação dos 11 Principios do Design de Interação</i></b> (<a href="http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/11-principles-of-interaction-design-explained" title="http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/11-principles-of-interaction-design-explained" rel="nofollow">http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/11-principles-of-interaction-design-ex...</a>)</p>
<p>Concordo plenamente quando Paul Seys sugere os "11 Princípios para o IxD".</p>
<p><b>1. Combinar experiências e expectativas</b><br />
Concordo que o Design de Interação deve está sempre aliado as expectativas do consumidor. Da mesma forma que um produto que tem um bom Design de Interação pode ser ovacionado, um produto mal desenhado pode ser mal visto.<br />
Quando lí o o livro "A cabeça de Steve Jobs", fiquei impressionado quando o autor cita que nos produtos da Apple sempre são observados os mínimos detalhes, até coisas que as empresas não ligam muito, como por ex. o manual de instruções, a embalagem do produto, dentre outros.</p>
<p><b>2. Coerência</b><br />
Em um Design de Interação deve haver a coerência entre os elementos. Isso eu considero básico no design de um projeto.</p>
<p><b>3. Funcional Minimalismo</b><br />
Realmente, um design simples e bonito é muito mais agradável que um design rebuscado e complexo.<br />
Quem não gosta de usar um sistema simples?<br />
Por ex.: twitter.</p>
<p><b>4. Carga Cognitiva</b><br />
Essa parte complementa a parte do Minimalismo. Percebemos que um design que lhe faça pensar pouco e agir rápido é agradável.<br />
Também podemos usar como exemplo o twitter. Você precisa pensar muito para usar ele? Não, o twitter é intuitivo.</p>
<p><b>5. Engajamento</b><br />
O usuário deve sempre se sentir engajado no design. Ele deve se sentir como se fizesse parte daquele sistema. Assim, como o próprio Paul Seys diz "devemos permitir que o usuário se concentre em seu trabalho e não na UX".</p>
<p><b>6. Layout Funcional</b><br />
Em um IxD devemos facilitar a busca e o uso das ferramentas mais utilizadas pelos usuários.<br />
No caso das ferramentas avançadas, devemos fazer uma explicação do uso de cada uma, para que assim o usuário tenha um maior conhecimento sobre aquilo que está trabalhando.</p>
<p><b>7. Controle, Confiança e Explorabilidade</b><br />
Um bom design de interface tem que fazer o usuário se sentir confortável, confiável. Se um usuário se sente confortável ele irá usar mais aquele sistema, assim um usuário que usa muito um sistema e se sente confiável nele, o usuário irá sentir que o sistema irá lhe proteger e assim ele estará inspirando confiança e conseqüentemente pronto para explorar livremente o sistema, sem medo de se sentir estúpido por ter feito algo errado.</p>
<p><b>8. Erros: prevenção, detecção e recuperação</b><br />
Prevenção: devemos prevenir o usuário de cometer algum erro que ele provavelmente irá se arrepender de ter feito e conseqüentemente sentirá um desgosto pelo sistema. Devemos prevenir mostrando avisos para as modificações mais avançadas, devemos exibir descrições e instruções de ajuda caso algo dê errado.<br />
Detecção: devemos receber feedback dos usuários, assim iremos detectar o que eles realmente queriam fazer e se eles alcançaram o objetivo.<br />
Recuperação: devemos exibir formas de voltar, cancelar ou desfazer as ultimas modificações que foram feitas.</p>
<p>Ou seja, devemos está sempre pensando a frente do usuário, para evitar que ele tenha algum descontentamento com o sistema.</p>
<p><b>9. Mousing</b><br />
Achei interessante a idéia da Lei de Fitts, em que diz</p>
<p>"O tempo necessário para clicar em um objeto é proporcional à distância e inversamente proporcional ao tamanho do objeto."</p>
<p>Eu não conhecia essa lei, mais gostei muito, vou até aplicar em meus projetos futuros.</p>
<p><b>10. Affordance</b><br />
Interessante essa idéia. Lendo essa parte, lembrei dos botões tipo interruptores do iOS.</p>
<p><b>11. Hierarquia de Controle</b><br />
Concordo com essa parte, realmente fica mais simples e é mais  intuitivo o uso de controles hierárquicos. Mas na minha opinião, esses controles são poucos usados.</p>
<p><b>Conclusão</b><br />
Podemos aliar todo o aprendizado desse artigo com o que vemos do IxD do iOS e dos produtos da Apple.<br />
Em minha opinião, o IxD da Apple serve como fonte de estudo para quem está iniciando nessa área.</p>
<p>Bom o que pude entender foi isso. Espero que atenda as proposições feitas na 'aula'.</p>

    <p>I'd like to complement what Rafael posted about Fitt's Law. It's a mathematical equation where the miliseconds taken to act are related to the size and distance of an object. Remember that I commented about the subjective characteristics of the Design vocabulary? Fitt's Law is the opposite; it tries to bring mathematical knowledge to interfaces (on a way too much objective way). It is a great principle, but it shouldn't be used to restrain the designer from going beyond borders.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The article I chose was "Make It So: What Interaction Designers can Learn from Science Fiction Interfaces" which can be found here: <a href="http://bit.ly/eGvnYG" title="http://bit.ly/eGvnYG" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/eGvnYG</a></p>
<p>First of all this article has made me understand why I've been a fan of movies that involved machines, robots and interfaces that consisted of a high level of anthropomorphism. I've never really liked science fiction films that included machines or interfaces that had no humanness to them.</p>
<p>The article focused mainly on interface and interaction design, and it's main premise is that the design of interfaces, systems, machines or robots in reality are influenced by Science Fiction and vice versa. It shares the idea that the technologies we see in many popular SciFi movies are based on current paradigms, or what an audience within that time can understand or relate to. But what SciFi does is build upon these paradigms and add unique features to make the experience of using the product better, more exciting, or with features that could be included with the product in the future. When this is done designers can get a view of how a human would relate to this product/interface, as well as any possible problems that may occur using such designs, and once the technology is available the designer may try to bring that concept to reality. So the relationship of influence between SciFi devices/interfaces and real designs is mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>On the point of SciFi mirroring current design paradigms, I agree with this, because if we compare the interfaces used in recent SciFi movies such as James Cameron's "Avatar," we can see technologies with interfaces that employ the use of on screen gestures, similar to what is used for real products such as the Iphone or Ipad. If Avatar was made back in the 1960's I highly doubt that a depiction of the future in the movie would include on screen gestural interfaces because the audience would not be able to relate to it.</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the influence relationship however, in the movie Gamer (2009), we can see the use of body gestures used to control games. When I saw this movie I thought it would be really cool if we could control games in a similar fashion, in reality. Then in 2010 Microsoft launched Kinect for their Xbox gaming system, which uses a similar paradigm to control its games. I'm not sure if the designers at Microsoft saw the movie Gamer, but it's highly likely that this SciFi concept could have influenced the design of the Kinect system, and therefore proves that SciFi does influence real designs in a positive way.</p>
<p>This concept of fiction and reality influencing each other is not entirely new because I've heard stories of various military groups employing film makers to think of scenarios of possible attacks, so that the army could prepare for those attacks, just in case they occurred in reality. The article I chose just applies this concept to the field of Interface and Interaction Design.</p>
<p>The author of the article concludes with the thought that watching science fiction can actually be beneficial to our careers as designers, and I agree totally. I think the ideas expressed through SciFi can help us as User Experience Designers to be more creative, and maybe even expose us to ideas we weren't exposed to previously. And if we can implement these ideas or concepts into our work, combined with our own ideas or concepts, we could make the world a better place through the design of better, more usable and fun products and services, whether they be physical or virtual.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I read the article “Simplicity Is Highly Overrated” from <a href="http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/simplicity-is-highly-overrated/" title="http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/simplicity-is-highly-overrated/" rel="nofollow">http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/simplicity-is-highly-overrated/</a> to <a href="http://jnd.org/dn.mss/simplicity_is_highly_overrated.html" title="http://jnd.org/dn.mss/simplicity_is_highly_overrated.html" rel="nofollow">http://jnd.org/dn.mss/simplicity_is_highly_overrated.html</a>.</p>
<p>Simplicity is always the goal when I design. So when I read the title of the article “Simplicity Is Highly Overrated,” I had to read it. When I was learning how to write a paper in English, my instructor said to keep sentences simple. When I was doing a storyboard for a short animation, my teacher advised us to keep stories simple. When I read articles online about design principles, the author wrote one principle as keeping design simple. If simplicity is something we need emphasis that much, why is simplicity overrated as Don Norman claimed?</p>
<p>Don Norman used the experience when he went to South Korea about how complexity sells. This phenomenon is everywhere. I had similar experience, too. When I buy a product, I compare prices, designs, and functions. The more you buy, the more you save. This is just the way people think. When you buy a product with more functions, you think you get more. Because complexity looks more powerful, you think you need products that look complex with more functions. Even though you rarely use most of the functions later, or never. But as long as marketing keeps the way like this, complexity is here with us. I think another reason people like to buy products with complex design is because it makes them look smarter. It is a sign of higher status and power.</p>
<p>Now back to simplicity. If simplicity does not sell, why do we need it? I think the main reason simplicity is emphasized that much is because we have too much complexity around. We waste too much time and energy on figuring out how to use complex things, thus simplicity comes back. By simple, it is not about doing things all in one button; it is about the necessity. If the product has only two functions and they suit your needs, it is fine. But everyone has different needs, products start to get packed with all kinds of functions to suit most people’s needs. Then things start to get complex. It is unavoidable, and complexity sells as the article mentioned. This is where the designers come in. Designers have to figure out the necessities for the users, depending on different situations. Too complex and too simple things are hard to use. I think simplicity is best described as Albert Einstein said, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.” Designers should think about the necessity, and design for it.</p>

    <p>Agree totally, but the "complexity sells" paradigm is changing everywhere you look, it's because complexity is not economically viable to couple with personalization, if you mass-produce complexity its just that... difficult to use and not in tune with particular needs. </p>
<p>Why is personalization important? Well as we move away from the mass production of the Industrial Revolution the key to "selling" will be satisfying the need for individuation, which will be the key social imperative in the coming years (Alvin Toffler's The Third Wave).</p>
<p>The solution to this problem? Simple products that are easily adaptable to your particular needs (like the iPhone).</p>

    <p>Can't stop laughing after watching this video!<br />
I really think that simplicity is one of the hardest things to achieve as a designer, in fact the things that we have to design are usually complex, but the aim is to hide all this complexity behind user-friendly products, interfaces, websites...</p>

<p>The following statement made intrigues me:<br />
"" As Henry Ford says, “if I had have asked my customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse”: people can’t project beyond their current experience to meet a future need.  That’s the designer’s job."" </p>
<p>It calls deeper to me as a designer to maintain a steady course in projecting future needs.</p>
<p>""We can’t change a person, but we can influence the way they behave by shaping the environment they function within."" </p>
<p>I love this. Not only as a graphic designer, but also thinking about the office I just completed building (<a href="http://www.FranklinCreativeSuite.com" title="http://www.FranklinCreativeSuite.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.FranklinCreativeSuite.com</a>), and how it is built to produce and inspire a certain level of work, as well as a niche. </p>
<p>A great article on design for cognitive behavioral patterns.</p>

    <p>For this assignment, I chose <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/01/03/objectified-design/" title="http://gigaom.com/2010/01/03/objectified-design/" rel="nofollow">http://gigaom.com/2010/01/03/objectified-design/</a><br />
which loosely highlighted two areas:<br />
1.) Strong design should aim for the "at course!" factor, not the "wow!" factor (in a way, directly related to Wei-Ching's post on simplicity vs. complexity sells).<br />
2.) The "of course" factor is achieved by an "undesigned" quality--removing features that "vy for your attention" and leaving "what is important."</p>
<p>It seems to me that the "of course" factor is no easy task, and may be the most critical part of design--many of us accept the shortfalls of products we use everyday and fail to see what makes them cumbersome (forest, trees).  I hate using credit card machines--but why?  Isn't that detective work much of the meat of what designers do?</p>
<p>But instead of just using a subtractive approach--removing features until we're left with lean, significant elegance (ie Macbook Air)--I think we need to balance with a sense of the whole, how a user would move through several actions, and combinations of actions.  Does clicking this minimalist mouse hurt after a while?</p>

    <p>There's a nice thing there about the "of course" factor. Many designers, when trying to innovate, abandon common concepts already known by the users and apply their solution to the interface. The problem is when this kind of innovation doesn't go thru usability testing - that's very risky to business, as people may be unable to use the system appropriatedly. </p>
<p>I have a colleague of mine at college who always goes against me when we talk about obvious approaches in Design. She defends that "to design is to go beyond the obvious", but I do say that designing for the real world means analyzing pre-existing paradigms already established and then assimilating innovative concepts.</p>
<p>It's important to notice that this reflects in the incremental x radical innovation process discussed by Don Norman. Again, this must not be used as a limitation, but as a framework to innovate.</p>

<p>When i was initially introduced to the concept that more choice is a bad thing (on Differentiate or Die by Trout) i was, at first, skeptical.. by golly if i like chocolate i better have a ton of chocolate to choose from. </p>
<p>That was about 6 years ago, and from there on i have come across this concept many times... Malcom Gladwell pursues it quite well on Blink, and i guess we can all just see the results of giving the users "less" and making them happier as a result. </p>
<p>I guess that minimalism and the balance with interaction that Vanessa referred to is not about taking away complexity and features... its all about providing a simpler clearer route to success, less methods to achieve the same amount of Goals so to speak.</p>
<p>In particular i was very impressed by the difference between maximizers and "satisficers" the first being those that always fight for better results and the second being those that just want to get by. </p>
<p>What i read in the article matches perfectly with Krug's "dont make me think" in general people just want to get their Goals done as painlessly as possible, they are here to do stuff not interact with the design.</p>
<p>I guess the hardest part is beating your ego to an extent where you are not making "minimalist" design; you are just trying to get out of the way to allow people to do what they came here to do.</p>

    <p>I going to be agree with the Alex comment, because no is only “clear”, in fact a good balance between minimalism and interaction provide to the user a “going straight to the point” perception.</p>
<p>The only things you should give the impression to you are: 1 that you know what you do. And 2, that you are helping him achieve his goal. And this is best achieved if you are "going straight to the point".</p>

    <p>[ESP] Yo elegí “Make It So: What Interaction Designers can Learn from Science Fiction Interfaces”.</p>
<p>Una lectura muy interesante que me dejo con ganas de leer el material que afirman haber dejado a un lado para enfocarse en la relación Diseño-Interface (muy acertado pues la relación ciencia ficción-ingeniería tiene demasiadas aristas).</p>
<p>“How design influences SciFi and how SciFi influences design”  en un que considero relacionado artículo “From Science Fiction to Innovation in the Field of Industrial Design” el autor Lavinia Manea nos señala que la innovación es un proceso continuo que va de la realidad a la ficción y de la ficción a la realidad.</p>
<p>Totalmente de acuerdo, vivimos inmersos en un contexto y el contexto nos influencia, muchas de las ideas de hoy se parecen a los diseños futuristas de la series de ciencia ficción de pasado. O no les recuerdan los teléfonos celulares al comunicador de la serie “Viaje a las Estrellas”. Esto no es extraño ni anormal muchos de los diseñadores que hoy trabajan para las grandes empresas fueron niños de esa época y están influenciados por esas ideas. </p>
<p>Pero a su vez, ellos influencian la tecnología, pues mucha veces tiene ideas propias con las que incluyen pequeñas modificación, que quizá no son posibles con la tecnología actual pero serán posibles en breve con tecnología en desarrollo, como “implantes auditivos” o “sistemas localización global sub cutáneos”.</p>
<p>Otro análisis que se debe hacer al diseñar es que la aceptación de las personas a ciertas tecnologías también se ve influenciada por el contexto histórico. Por ejemplo: En las películas clásicas al voltear al futuro la interface más aceptada para controlar maquinas es la voz. Hace un par de años el controlar dispositivos utilizando computadores (video/joystick/Ratón) era la más común. Hoy día vemos como ya muchos autores coquetean con la introducción de interfaces neurales (dispositivos insertos en el cerebro).</p>
<p>Estoy seguro que a mis padres no les gustaría la idea de que nadie les introdujera un aparato de ningún tipo ni alambres en el cerebro. Para mi es interesante pero aun visto como muy peligroso. Pero para mi sobrino es muy “en onda” utilizar un juego que ha salido al mercado y se controla con la mente.</p>
<p>En este sentido existe algo paradójico, la comunicación funciona de modo distinto. La aparición del telégrafo, fue ampliamente aceptada. Fue mejorada y desplazado por el teléfono que nos dejaba escuchar la voz de nuestro interlocutor. La popularidad actual del “Skype” y otros medios de video comunicación son innegables, pero aun así estamos fascinados por la posibilidad de poder tener la presencia virtual de una persona como ocurre en los las saga de los capítulos I, II y III de Star Wars. La conclusión posible a esto podría ser que el realismo le da aceptación al diseño de la interface.</p>
<p>Pero se debe tener cuidado con la última afirmación. La actitud que produce el diseño en la interacción es otro factor, es interesante la innovación pero el diseño debe ir adoptándola gradualmente, quizá si la aparición de dispositivos como el Nintendo Wii no se hubiese dado, interfaces de control como el Kinetic no serían tan populares, pero recuerde que Nintendo viene de tener pad y joysticks como controles de su consola.</p>
<p>Lo cognitivo (el conocimiento) es otra variable que interviene, hemos dicho que el diseño de una interface debe ser instintivo. Al ver un teclado lo primero que uno piensa es en escribir cosas con sus teclas pero esto viene porque algún día existieron máquinas de escribir, quizá una interface de ventanas tipo “Minority Report” no sería tan intuitiva para el que nació en 1930, como un teclado no lo sería para un hombre prehistórico. </p>
<p>En la conclusión el autor afirma “This is only the beginning. There's a lot more lessons we're learning and a lot more properties to explore” cosa con lo que concuerdo pues aunque el contexto referencial es una base de partida para el diseño, las modificaciones alternativas, la investigación y principalmente la imaginación son las principales herramientas que construirán el futuro del diseño y que son la vida que alimenta nuestras historias de ciencia ficción.</p>

<p>I agree with the author that changing behaviour is possible and takes time. I see that contemplating on myself, looking at me and my girlfriend. Haha. It needs a lot of dedication that´s sure. How do i see that from a designer perspective? Hmm. I think we have to think out of the box, have a given task that challenges our capacities and again dedication (at the world of opportunities.)<br />
I don´t think that we have to focus to much on the future. As there has been really useful and good things also in the past. And first of all we should focus on the present. And moreover on one given task/challenge, not more!<br />
The ABC of Behaviour<br />
"We can’t change a person, but we can influence the way they behave by shaping the environment they function within … through good design we have the ability to shape and influence someone’s behaviour."<br />
--&gt;That is absolutly right. But only the quantity of users really change the user as well as the application. I see the cause impact model more like that. </p>
<p><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/intent-behaviour-small.gif" title="http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/intent-behaviour-small.gif" rel="nofollow">http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/intent-behaviour-small.gif</a></p>
<p>As the author say: "Without going too deeply into the cognitive side of things, it’s important to keep in mind that behaviour is often not intentional  or controlled at all.   With conscious thought believed to play a small role in the decision making process."</p>
<p><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/stages-change-small.gif" title="http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/stages-change-small.gif" rel="nofollow">http://johnnyholland.org/wp-content/uploads/stages-change-small.gif</a></p>
<p>--&gt; so it is a revolving process </p>
<p>There are many rules stated. I go with that that a designer should always rely on field obeservation of his work and should try to dig deep in the users mind (his target client).</p>

    <p>I read the article "Abductive Thinking and Sensemaking: The Drivers of Design Synthesis" <a href="http://jonkolko.com/writingAbductiveThinking.php" title="http://jonkolko.com/writingAbductiveThinking.php" rel="nofollow">http://jonkolko.com/writingAbductiveThinking.php</a></p>
<p>The article discusses various methods for gathering information and putting information to use to develop design solutions.  To me a lot of the techniques were informative and I can see how they can help to stimulate thought and lead to innovative design, however, I am not sure that these methods are the only way for invention.</p>
<p>First, one of the definitions given for design is "organizing complexity of finding clarity in chaos," I disagree with the definition and think design is more than a method of organization and is an art form appealing to emotional desires.</p>
<p>Kolko argues abductive reasoning is the "best" logic for design because it opens the mind to make leaps and unobvious connections.  For this type of logic, methods such as reframing, concept mapping, and insight combination are suggested.  The arguments that are made for these thought processes to stimulate new design make a lot of sense to me, but I do not think these are the sole methods for establishing this goal.  New experiences and taking yourself out of a routine are great stimulates for making new and innovative connections.  In the article I believe informal modes of inspiration are overlooked and undervalued.</p>

    <p>Escolhi o texto “Technology First, Needs Last”, de Don Norman [1]. Sua tese principal é: “New conceptual breakthroughs are invariably driven by the development of new technologies”. Mais especificamente, as inovações de sucesso não são as mais revolucionárias (“[…] it is exciting to contemplate some brand new concept that will change people's lives, but the truth is that most fail”), mas as que representam um pequeno avanço tecnológico em relação a produtos já existentes (“In reality, innovation comes in many shapes and forms. […] Most new product development is innovative, but at a very tiny, incremental level”).</p>
<p>O autor afirma ainda que as invenções que mudaram a humanidade (avião, automóvel, computador, celular) não foram criadas com base em estudos etnográficos ou pesquisas sobre as necessidades dos consumidores (“What role did design research play? What role did marketing research play? No role. All were driven by technology”). Para Norman, elas surgiram porque a tecnologia possibilitou que elas pudessem se tornar realidade.</p>
<p>O autor diz ainda que ideias novas enfrentam sérios obstáculos e que grandes ideias falharam porque estavam à frente do seu tempo. Mas não é que ele acredite que as pesquisas de design sejam inúteis: “This is where ethnographic observation can be powerful, discovering the difficulties people have in everyday use, the workarounds and hacks they invent that suggest product modifications”. Em outras palavras, a pesquisa é mais útil para refinar o desenvolvimento do produto do que para criar um produto do zero.</p>
<p>No fim de seu artigo, ele resume novamente seu pensamento: “The inventors will invent, for that is what inventors do. The technology will come first, the products second, and then the needs will slowly appear, as new applications become luxuries, then ‘needs’, and finally, essential”.</p>
<p>Colocando “a tecnologia primeiro e as necessidades por último”, o autor pode ter generalizado demais. Porém, esse artigo vem ao encontro de uma reflexão minha na área de estudos do meu curso (Jornalismo) e me leva a concluir que inovações de impacto podem não atender necessidades, mas *criar* necessidades. Eis a reflexão.</p>
<p>Recentemente foi lançado nos EUA o The Daily [2] [3], primeiro jornal criado exclusivamente para iPad. A primeira vista, pensei que seria apenas uma grande jogada de marketing pegando carona no sucesso do tablet da Apple. Grandes jornais e revistas, no Brasil e no mundo, já têm suas versões digitais. Imaginei que o The Daily seria como qualquer um deles, só que sem versão impressa.</p>
<p>Ao ver mais detalhes, percebi que há uma série de características – o design do app, a diagramação (mais leve, parecida com a de revista), o conteúdo multimídia, a integração com redes sociais, entre outras – que, inéditas ou não, mostram que o The Daily não é uma mera adaptação para o iPad, mas sim algo projetado e pensado para o aparelho em todos os seus aspectos.</p>
<p>O mais interessante é que nem o The Daily nem o iPad são produtos essenciais: as pessoas já lidam com equivalentes deles. Ou seja, eles não surgiram a partir de uma demanda, mas de uma oportunidade (o advento atual da tecnologia). Seus criadores devem estar apostando que, assim que fizerem sucesso, as pessoas não saberão mais como viviam sem eles. Portanto, as inovações, ou a maioria delas, seriam guiadas pela tecnologia, e não pelas necessidades.</p>
<p>PS: peço desculpas se não consegui ser muito claro!</p>

    <p>I chose the article “Emotion and Design: Attractive things work better” by Don Norman. </p>
<p>This was to me the classic “Form over Function or Function over Form” argument. Yet instead of arguing it he is, quite intelligently, giving a detailed, insightful dissertation on why “Form” is needed, essential even.  I know most of us are most likely designers and so would almost always lean toward this understanding, yet he seems to be speaking to the “Function” tent.  As a fellow “Functioner”, wooing them into the understanding of the psychological and anthropological evidence for the effectiveness of aesthetics in common life. How this aesthetic can, in fact, improve the response or feeling of their “Function”. </p>
<p>He gives a great example of the early days of personal computing. Black and white monitors displayed nothing but information meant to accomplish a task. Yet, even in that simplicity, businesses began trending to purchase color monitors for their employees. Borrowing a friends color monitor, he evaluated, after the allotted time that the color created no discernable value for getting the work done. However, he decided her would not go back to using the black and white monitor. His cognitive reasoning told him that the color made no difference, but his subjective emotions refused to comply. </p>
<p>I am a Macintosh guy, have been since before I can remember. The Microsoft experience has always baffled me. I think back to the days when my family had our first computer running Windows 3.1.  I remember using it for the first time after having quite a bit of experience running MacOS at school. The sheer rigidity and homeliness of it sold me forever on Apple. I had no use for its function, which was most likely comparable to the Mac. Using the Windows system, although sufficient in function, gave off a truly negative response when contrasted with another equally sufficient experience that was also aesthetically pleasing. </p>
<p>Ah, but lest you think he ends, as all designers wish he would, on that premise, he doesn’t. The truth being, as we all know, that a balance of form and function is needed for any great user experience. Using my previous example, the original Windows software I felt had a horrendous experience because of its sheer lack of anything aesthetic. Yet, using Windows 7 today is a totally different thing. Function has finally met the balance of form to give the user a great experience. </p>
<p>I think as we talk about Human Interaction, I believe the interactional experience is always subject to the persons involved in the action. Meaning, the feeling that the action ensues is based solely upon the subjective, emotional experiences and responses of the user. Just as important as balance between Form and Function, if we do not have a good understanding of the specific audience or end user then it can and surely will cause a negative emotional response.  Technically, both Form and Function will be affected by this thought but it I believe it must be the glue that pulls the two together.</p>

    <p>I chose "Make It So: What Interaction Designers can Learn from Science Fiction Interfaces" (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/NathanShedroff/make-it-so" title="http://www.slideshare.net/NathanShedroff/make-it-so" rel="nofollow">http://www.slideshare.net/NathanShedroff/make-it-so</a>). In my spare time I write science fiction, so it was an easy choice for me :)</p>
<p>At any rate, the article touched on one of the things I've always enjoyed about science fiction: how its portrayal of the future is deeply informed by the culture of the author. For example, I once stumbled upon some paintings or postcards from around 100-150 years ago (I'm sorry I can't find the link, and my memory of these is a little hazy), depicting the artist's vision for the year 2000. It featured inventions such as a personal automated goose plucking machine, or a machine that automatically brought in firewood to your fireplace--stuff that would seem very practical and user-friendly if you lived on a European farm a century ago, but would ridiculous in a modern, urban apartment with central heat.</p>
<p>I also very much enjoyed the article's discussion on how sci-fi inspires interaction design. I'm fairly new to web design, and my skills are such that, when I consider the design of a new site, I can't help but view it through the lens of what I can reasonably accomplish given my as-yet limited skillset. However, I wonder if I would have more success if I considered the best possible site, then try to learn the skills to make it happen. </p>
<p>It is in this regard that the lessons of this article are most applicable. While science fiction is necessarily grounded in the milieu of its author, sci-fi has the luxury of not having to consider what is feasible, but only what is awesome. Ideas like Star Trek's communicators seemed so cool and useful on screen, they arguably inspired the cellular phone revolution. Science fiction can indirectly trigger great innovation by inspiring intelligent, capable people. That said, it's been twenty years already and they still haven't figured out how to make a Hoverboard from Back to the Future II.</p>
<p>The article made anohter point I found intersting--that anthropomorphising online interactions can be a dangerous game. While it can and has been done well in scenarios like Amazon's OneClick ordering, it can be useless or irritating if handled poorly. </p>
<p>It reminded me of the idea of the uncanny valley. A lot of you are probably already familiar with the uncanny valley, but if you're not, here's an oversimplified version: Basically, humans like it when machines act like people--up to a point. But once machines reach a the point where they're practically indistinguishable from humans, it triggers a strong reflex of revulsion. Obviously, Microsoft's animated paperclip is nothing like a real-live human (or even a real-live paperclip), but the fact that it's trying so hard to be helpful, to be empathetic to our problems as we struggle to create a table of contents or whatever, is off-putting. Some things can't be faked, and as designers, it's probably best to spend our energies trying to innovate in other areas.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>My take on "Make It So: What Interaction Designers can Learn from Science Fiction Interfaces[1]"</p>
<p>An overall interesting read, although the title made me expect a more focused, succinct essay on lessons designers could glean from science fiction. It starts by proposing that Reality sets the paradigm that sci-fi builds upon, which I think is a good observation of how contemporary design influences a generation of science fiction writers, film makers and other creatives as they imagine what future technology (and therefore future interfaces) would be like. In turn, science fiction inspires engineers, designers, and other similar professionals to look at what they know and figure out a way to realize what once existed only in the imagination.</p>
<p>In this way, we can say that the progress made in making science fiction concepts reality is Iteration on a collective, massive scale. Reality serves as a starting point from which science fiction can extrapolate possible future creations (tech, interfaces, etc), while science fiction serves as model for technologists and designers to strive towards and make real. Unlike iteration in the design lab, this process continues ad infinitum such that we probably have the faintest inkling of what is possible decades from now (I'll call this Science-Reality, short hand for Science Fiction into Reality and Reality into Science Fiction).</p>
<p>The authors then talk about Inspiration and Expectation, which seem distinct enough to justify talking about separately, although the examples given for each end up in a product too similar to the prototype to make the desired distinction clear. In the former, engineers saw a 3D map in the X-men movie and was inspired to create a system that uses a dynamic sand table and overhead projection to achieve a similar effect. In the latter generations of roboticists create humanoid robots because that is what science fiction usually depicts. I think a clearer analogy would have been engineers inspired by Rosie [2] from the Jetsons to create the Roomba[3], to contrast with engineers creating ASIMO[4] to conform to popular expectation as to what a robot is.</p>
<p>With those out of the way, the authors start to get to the lessons part of the article (there was one lesson in between the Inspiration and Expectation discussion, "Sci Fi is a powerful cultural influence. It affects designer's ideas as well as those of our clients and audiences." but it seems more like a factual observation to me).</p>
<p>Lesson one sounds like a re-hash of the Expectation section, but here the authors specify how interfaces can be determined by users' previous exposure to media, and as such, I think is a useful pointer to take from Science Fiction.</p>
<p>Next the authors caution designers from hewing too closely to established interfaces because doing so can detract from the user experience (The authors gave as cautionary tales Microsoft's effort at an office assistant, Clippy[5]--may he rest in peace--but showing restraint in introducing anthropomorphic or skeuomorphic details is still very much relevant in interface design) and I couldn't agree more. Just because a novel interface works well on screen/on paper doesn't mean it will be as easy or practical to use in real-life. The film Galaxy Quest[6] played this up to humorous effect when Cmdr. Taggart/Nesmith (Allen) has to relay his commands to Lt. Madison/DeMarco who then "interfaces" with the voice-commanded ship computer.</p>
<p>(Note: The next lesson, wading into the social context is more tricky than it looks, I can't really talk much about, as I have no idea how it relates to the other points the authors were trying to make.)</p>
<p>Lesson four talks about science fiction demonstrated that sound is sometimes enough to trigger anthropomorphism, which given the example of R2-D2[7], I can't really argue against.</p>
<p>The fifth lesson adds behavior to the methods an interface designer could learn from science fiction as they create real interfaces. Unfortunately, I don't quite understand what the authors wanted to convey by using Amazon's OneClick[8] as the archetype for behavior-induced anthropomorphism. It just seems to spare an interaction for me to equate with the human-like quality (shopkeeper or bartender) the authors are trying to equate with it.</p>
<p>The next lesson builds upon the preceding three lessons by postulating that the closer an interface imitates humans, the higher user expectations become. This sounds like good advice, but I think the author should have gone further and done one of two things: caution readers from trying to antropomorphize interfaces too much to avoid over-inflating user expectations, or encourage them to try to emulate complexity.</p>
<p>Lesson seven advises interface designers to include constraints into a design to aid users understand an interface even without the manual, which while sound advice, could've used a better example than the one the authors included: Lifted seems to be premised upon making fun of sci-fi interfaces by depicting a control board rife with what looks like switches. Not quite believable as something real-world engineers would be inspired by or users would expect.</p>
<p>The authors then point out the desirability of intelligent input devices, as depicted in such science fiction films as 2001[9] compared to dumb controls in The Fifth Element[10]. Here I think the authors singled out a great lesson interface designers could lift from sci-fi. A particular real-world application of this lesson would be accidental input filtering from track pads.</p>
<p>Next the authors point out the sci-fi trope of hierarchy being indicated by scale. I'm skeptical about the application of this lesson in real-world scenarios. For instance, imagine what your IM application's buddy list interface would look like if your contacts were displayed according to how important they were to you. How would you arrange such a list and where would additional information go (such as idle state &amp; username)? A well-thought out interface design might be able to incorporate scale-as-hierarchical-indicator or it might not.</p>
<p>The penultimate lesson states that "what works for audiences often works for users as well." I'm ambivalent about this lesson because it can both be true and false. The example given (Minority Report[11]) perfectly supports the point the authors are making because it shows a scenario where audiences accept the interface as something that makes sense, right down to the shortcoming the scene revealed. Unfortunately the same can be said of interfaces that audiences accept as realistic but could in reality have its own deficiencies such as transparent, vertical screens such as portrayed in Battlestar Galactica [12].</p>
<p>Finally, the authors contend that "watching science fiction can be beneficial to your career." to which I agree 100%.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I would like to share the article, “The A-B-C of Behaviour” by Jodie Moule for this week's assignment.</p>
<p>I really like Moule's example of the egg timer as a catalyst of change. She states the device immediately changed her water consumption behavior, and even mentions how it led to feelings of guilt when her usage went over the time allotted. It demonstrates how a simple device can have a huge impact on behavior.</p>
<p>People in this course who have read and shared this article pointed out, "We can’t change a person, but we can influence the way they behave by shaping the environment they function within." Moule emphasizes artifacts (e.g. the egg timer), and I really wanted her to go into more depth about this, or at least touch on some of the social aspects. Since she didn't, I will supplement it with Edwin Hutchin's theory of distributed cognition.</p>
<p>Edwin Hutchins is a Cognitive Scientist and the main developer of distributed cognition. [2] Distributed cognition is a framework that takes coordination between individuals, artifacts, and the environment into consideration. [2] Our behavior is not confined to the individual, but "is distributed by placing memories, facts, or knowledge on the objects, individuals, and tools in our environment." [2] I consider distance learning, such as P2PU, and collaborative tagging (e.g. the Twitter hashtag #) as modern applications of distributed cognition.<br />
 <br />
Here's an excellent excerpt on cognition from Hutchins' book, Cognition in the Wild:</p>
<p>". . . in watching the ant [in a complicated path across a beach], we learn more about the beach than about what is inside the ant. And in watching people thinking in the wild, we may be learning more about their environment for thinking than about what is inside them. Having realized this, we should not pack up and leave the beach, concluding that we cannot learn about cognition here. The environments of human thinking are not “natural” environments. They are artificial through and through. Humans create their cognitive powers by creating the environments in which they exercise those powers. At present, so few of us have taken the time to study these environments seriously as organizers of cognitive activity that we have little sense of their role in the construction of thought.</p>
<p>Moule makes a convincing argument about the impact of design on behavior; as designers "we can change behaviour through design of products, services and systems".[1] My only critique of this article (and design in general) is the lack of emphasis on the responsibility of the designer. If design is such a powerful tool, capable of changing behavior, then more weight should be placed on the impact of one's ideas and products. She alludes to this briefly at the end when shes states, "the best way to do this is to first consider the customers culture and context, before we even start on ideas." [1] I couldn't agree more, and this is where ethnographic studies and user research can help. To know a society's stories is to know where it intends to go [4], after all. I would go a step further and ask, how do we hold designers responsible for the ideas they put out in the world, where the effects are not readily visible or comprehensible? There is a current trend towards sustainable design, where the environment and the product life-cycle are taken into consideration – that's a good start, but it took us forever to get there!</p>

    <p>I agree, we should hold designers responsible for the ideas that they put into the world. Which means design needs to start thinking in a more sustainable manner. We can't keep making stuff to throw away in a year, like cellphones etc. We need to figure out how to conserve, reuse, and recycle materials. More on this in: <a href="http://eli.informatics.indiana.edu/P503-blevis.pdf" title="http://eli.informatics.indiana.edu/P503-blevis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://eli.informatics.indiana.edu/P503-blevis.pdf</a></p>

    <p>I read 'Controls and choices' <a href="http://www.designingdevices.com/controls-are-choices/" title="http://www.designingdevices.com/controls-are-choices/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designingdevices.com/controls-are-choices/</a></p>
<p>It's been a fruitful reading, as I kept thinking of different devices and their controls while following the article.</p>
<p>I'll take this sentence literally: 'Complexity just doesn't go awaý' as I think that it determines how difficult it is to deal with controls design and taking the correct decision to make a perfect balance between simplicity and giving options to users.</p>
<p>I find particularly complicated in controls selection, as do it too simple can bore easily, but doing it too complicated can be annoying, and probably the answer here is (as always) in target users and figuring out which are their real needs, which makes me think of reading Don Norman´s article´'Technology First, Needs Last'.</p>

    <p>Here are my thoughts about the "11 Principles of Interaction Design Explained" [1].</p>
<p>“Avoid unnecessary features and functions” or “Limit functions rather than the user experience” : easier said. The clients are usually not the end users. They are the founder though. I mean sometimes it’s hard to negotiate with client and make them understand that what they want doesn’t necessarily match what the end users want.<br />
“An engaging experience is not only more enjoyable, but also easier and more productive.” It’s important to say that user experience doesn’t only need to be pleasant. It also needs to help doing tasks in an effective way.<br />
I also like the idea that good design may help users forget about everything around them.<br />
“We should allow users to concentrate on their work, not on the user interface”. In other words, this means that a good design should be imperceptible.</p>
<p>In the article, I also learned that there’s a name given to the principle which says that “20% of the functionality is used 80% of the time”. I’m more than convinced by that and I wished I could be able to verify it on web applications. Are there any tools for that ? Recently, I looked for free (an open source) library or software to track mouse events on a web page. I didn’t find anything really exciting and, to be honest, was thinking about creating my own.<br />
“Making most common or important functions easiest to find” is what I try to fight everyday for in my company. I like the idea that an interface should look simple at first sight even if it is not. I also like the idea that an interface could seem or be different depending on much the user gets used to the application.<br />
The author advices to “place elements that will be used together in close proximity to each other”. This is probably something that I unconsciously do when designing web interfaces but I think that it will give it more importance in my future works.</p>
<p>The author finally says that “controls which affect an object, should be grouped with the object”. I can’t agree more. And the example of the map navigation controls fits me perfectly in the sense that web mapping applications is my everyday job. The notion of hierarchy of groups is a bit new for me though. I’m really happy to learn and give it a try in the future.</p>

    <p>I'm going to defend Don Norman's point of view in a more practical way.</p>
<p>I found the video from Don Norman a real entertainer. The ideas of BMW and Mercedes Benz to give the user a centralized control over all aspects of there cars. Altering the volume of the car radio required at least four steps. And this were they went wrong as stated in [7] <a href="http://uxmag.com/design/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design;" title="http://uxmag.com/design/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design;" rel="nofollow">http://uxmag.com/design/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design;</a> “People Don't Want to Work or Think More Than They Have To” give them defaults. So often used controls should be a. enabled by default or b. require the least amount of interaction. One of the first Basic Principles of HCI<br />
is “Requirements Analysis  Agree on the users' needs and aim for usability requirements.”[2] <a href="http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/computer-interaction-site" title="http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/computer-interaction-site" rel="nofollow">http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/computer-interaction-site</a></p>
<p>Also all the same buttons to control parameters from the car do not take a mental models into consideration. I've just got my new iphone4. I never owned an idevice. I was fiddling with ipod function and stumbled upon this GREAT mental model of how to shuffle song; just by shaking my iphone4! I think it's genius and thought “That's how you make use of metal models!” So probably touch screen or just by motion sensors where the user make clockwise circle motion to pump up the volume would be a better solution.<br />
I think this where BMW and Mercedes Benz went wrong. They looked at there problem of giving the user full-control and probably out off a marketing point of view; a strategy. Tedde van Gelderen is mentioning in the third YouTube movie [6.3] <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7sL9g8homo&amp;feature=channel" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7sL9g8homo&amp;feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7sL9g8homo&amp;feature=channel</a>  “A common error to jump to the design stage and don't do some extensive research.”</p>

    <p>Jodi Forlizzi and Katja Battarbee, “Understanding Experience in Interactive Systems” (2004)<br />
<a href="http://goo.gl/PFGY4" title="http://goo.gl/PFGY4" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/PFGY4</a></p>
<p>After reading this article, my eyes were opened a entirely new thought process. Never before had I looked at the design of a particuliar website/app as something that could have such a large effect on the users emotions. Previously, I thought data was the most important element in interactive development. Now, I will always take a closer look at how the display of that data will make the user feel, on a level they may not even realize.  </p>
<p>This article focused on the interactions between people and products, and the experience that results. There are particular elements that can effect the result. Emotion plays a large role in the type of experience we have as a user. The emotion created then effects us in three ways:</p>
<p>"From a psychological standpoint, emotion has three basic functions: to shape our plans and intentions, to organize the procedures related to the plans, and to evaluate outcomes. From a design standpoint, emotion shapes the gap that exists between people and products in the world."</p>
<p>Creating an emotion for the user through the design can have an effect on the overall message of the brand. If you a looking to convey simplicity in your brand, having a complex website will have a negative effect. The article also stated:</p>
<p>"Pleasure that results from interacting with products may be any benefit that is perceived in the product."</p>
<p>Sometimes, I feel the designer may forget it not only about the visual looking great. That design influences the way the user has an experience. When designers create a print ad, there is a history of how the final product will create emotions. Often it is done through layout or copy. Today, in digital design, the experience of interacting with the piece can create that same effect. For example, the author talked about a user experience:</p>
<p>"Users need to attain fluency with the product early on, to ensure that they will continue to use the product and not abandon it in frustration. This means that minimal time can be invested in learning the basic controls, and that use should be rewarding from the start."</p>
<p>Holding a magazine or driving past a billboard is not the same as visiting a website and interacting with it. When designing for a print ad, you know your time is limited and that the messaging and emotion needs to be delivered quickly. The user has experience interacting with a print ad, there is not a learning curve. The interaction a user has with a website is completely different. They have invested some time to investigating what the current site has to offer. They also need to invest time understanding how the data is distributed and where to find the information they need. </p>
<p>The article also mentions "...prototypes to be very useful for learning about what social interactions and co-experiences can potentially unfold."<br />
I agree. The quickest way to understand how a user will react is to see them interacting with your digital design. All to often elements are overlooked because the developer may not have anticipated a particular users reaction.  </p>

    <p>I'd like to use the article "Good Design in the Digital Age" (<a href="http://id.bobulate.com/readings/gooddesign.pdf" title="http://id.bobulate.com/readings/gooddesign.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://id.bobulate.com/readings/gooddesign.pdf</a>) as a starting point to developing language around and criteria for measuring "good design".</p>
<p>"Good Design in the Digital Age" posits the question "What is good design?"  Buchanan discusses the difference between culturally accepted definitions of "good design" from the 50's to what "good design" means now. In the 50's designers concerned themselves with "form, function,  and materials and the manner of industrial production", they designed from an external perspective. Designs were created as entities unto themselves, and were judged externally too –– "there was little sense of the context in which products would be used by people in daily life." Fast forward to the year 2000. The perspective on design has shifted from external to internal where it is specifically concerned with the human experience –– "designers explore what is useful, usable and desirable in products". Designers are no longer working solitarily and products are not seen as simply by themselves, they are seen in conjunction with the interaction with other products or services within the company. Now there are teams formed around exploring human experience with products; designers work in with cognitive psychologists, social scientists, usability experts, and marketing strategists. </p>
<p>Buchanan attempts to set up some criteria for judgement of good design.<br />
1. What is the intended use?<br />
2. How will it fit into a users life?<br />
3. Has the content been organized clearly and efficiently?<br />
4. Is the product easily accessible?<br />
5. Is the product useable from the first screen?<br />
6. Does the product demonstrate an understanding of the needs and limitations of its user?<br />
7. Does the product engage its user?<br />
8. Does the product please and delight its user?<br />
9. When the user has a choice of a similar variety of products, why would they choose this product?</p>
<p>For Buchanan then, the main qualities of good design are "usefulness, usability, and desirability" and how these attributes are used to effectively communicate. I think this is a great starting point, but in order to measure what makes up "good design" we need to create an even more thorough framework by which to judge  and evaluate design.</p>

    <p>Sorry for the late post! Anyway, I read Ben Bashford’s Emoticomp:  <a href="http://journal.benbashford.com/post/2848763029" title="http://journal.benbashford.com/post/2848763029" rel="nofollow">http://journal.benbashford.com/post/2848763029</a>, where he discusses the need of embedding identities and personalities within smart products, and the various ways they’ve been implemented effectively, as well as wrongly: Clippy the paperclip from MS Office, had been too aggressive of an implementation and ended up being intrusive to the user’s working space, while Breakfast’s Precious - Bike with a Brain (<a href="http://yesiamprecious.com/" title="http://yesiamprecious.com/" rel="nofollow">http://yesiamprecious.com/</a>) tweets about its progress on its journey across the USA,  based on its current temperature, humidity, location, speed, direction, etc. Precious’ tweets oozes with personality and is filled with snide comments, but at the end of the day, it was a very passive and subtle presence. </p>
<p>The article does not come to a conclusion. While we try to build identities and trigger emotions from our end users through the use of tone, voice, colours and various other design principles, the idea of giving personas or personalities to products and devices we interact with is still not one that users accept easily. It’s one that users will react negatively to if done incorrectly; in the case they become annoying or intrusive as with the Clippy example.</p>
<p>Here is one that I came across awhile back that I thought was an awesome design/implementation of a persona with a product: <a href="http://benthebodyguard.com/" title="http://benthebodyguard.com/" rel="nofollow">http://benthebodyguard.com/</a></p>

    <p>I've read Bill Buxton's “Performance by Design: The Role of Design in Software Product Development” (2003). <a href="http://www.billbuxton.com/SoftwareDesign.pdf" title="http://www.billbuxton.com/SoftwareDesign.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.billbuxton.com/SoftwareDesign.pdf</a></p>
<p>Buxton talks about the importance of a front-end design process, like pre-production in the film industry. He argues that companies need to take design seriously. He doesn't use the expression 'User Experience Designer' but you get the importance of this professional. Someone that has a central role in the process of design.</p>
<p>It's understood that we should improve design and usability even when the competitors aren't doing so. And that we may look for inspiration in other fields' processes. That developers and designer should work together, integrated. </p>
<p>I've particularly enjoyed learning that: “Engineers view prototypes as part of the process of building things. Designers build prototypes to criticize and tear apart.” I believe that it's helpful to know that others that are working with you may be having a totally different view of what is being done.</p>
<p>I've chosen this article because many of my friends that are also designers often get disappointed at their jobs. I believe that most of the times it is because design is not receiving enough attention and things are not being well planned. You can't just call the designer when things need to be fixed. Even though at the same time I feel that design is receiving more recognition than ever. I guess the problem is that sometimes people don't know what to expect from the designers.</p>
<p>I've select this paragraph to share with you:<br />
"While the back-end engineering process is about getting things right, the front end is loaded towards making errors sooner rather than later, detecting them, and learning from them. One key to “sketching” in this context, is ensuring that the cost of errors, and the subsequent lessons, is contained within acceptable limits. The other key is recognizing that the generation of ideas is targeted at converging on a design, rather than adding diversity for novelty’s sake. Hence, the process is represented as a funnel, in which ideas are explored and refined. At the beginning, ideas are “cheap” and lightweight processes are all that are needed to evaluate them. As they become more and more refined, so does the investment that we have in them, so therefore the rigor with which they are examined increases. This continues up to the point where they are brought forward for formal go/no go evaluation as part of the green light process."</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I came across this just now on IxD: <a href="http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/an-archive-for-interaction-design/" title="http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/an-archive-for-interaction-design/" rel="nofollow">http://theixdlibrary.com/articles/an-archive-for-interaction-design/</a>. Just earlier I was thinking about the same thing, the process of saving and documenting what we do.</p>
<p>The article is a blog post by designer Khoi Vinh titled "An Archive for Interaction Design." He discusses the issue of making archives of our work, whether for ourselves as portfolio pieces or for posterity. The problem is that digital media is a conversation. Conversations are something you experience, and this experience is something that is impossible to relive after the fact.</p>
<p>Vinh states, "Digital media is a conversation that has no end, a conversation that changes constantly. And as an industry, our attempts at archiving digital design have been less than satisfactory."</p>
<p>I agree with this statement. Our industry has not taken the time or effort to safekeep the work that is being produced. To bring clarity, let's visit the analog world. Business cards and first proofs can be stored away to quickly be retrieved later. Metal and glass, if maintained, can last lifetimes. But at what point is Facebook or Twitter a 'final product' that you can take a picture of show to later generations? Because these are conversations, it seems nearly impossible. The only way it seems, is that you either interrupt the conversation or stage it. But doing either of those will result in a skewed picture. Because you tampered with it, it's not accurate, it's not real.</p>
<p>I think about even my own personal portfolio iterations. I found something from two or three years ago just yesterday. It made me smile. But how do I archive it? It's a website, so it's in a folder with a bunch of other elements. I have no reason to ever go to this folder. I only opened it because it came up on system wide search, and happened to have the same piece of code as a current project I'm working on.</p>
<p>Vihn's closes with, "Every time a site or an application gets a major upgrade, every time an interface is overhauled, it represents something learned, knowledge accrued to advance the craft. But we won’t benefit easily from these revelations if we don’t do the hard work of archiving these steps forward."</p>
<p>We are left with a great question: "How, and what, do we archive?"</p>
<p>I know I don't have an absolute the answer to this. But that won't stop me from trying. I've kept everything I've ever made, all the way back to when I was using PowerPoint to make stuff. Maybe one day there will be a way for me to assemble it into a meaningful and accessible gallery. Until that time comes, I'm going to keep on saving everything.</p>

    <p>I read the article, <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/26-the-myth-of-discoverability/" rel="nofollow">The myth of discoverability</a> by Scott Berkun, August 2003.</p>
<p>I chose it because I've been working on an older software product (nearing it's 11th year) which has over a thousand screens - many of which are very complex. After 3.5 years I still find pages which I've never seen before. We're constantly adding new sections, new buttons, new options, configuration, etc. How do you make something stand out and de-emphasize the lower priority elements?</p>
<p>I thought Berkun did a reasonable job at covering the common sense concepts of how everything in design is a trade-off, you're always making compromises and there is no such thing as the ideal perfect design. You're always going to be short-changing someone or some feature in order to make another one more prominent.</p>
<p>I liked how he spelled out the general priorities:</p>
<p>1. Things most people do, most often.<br />
2. Things most people do, somewhat often.<br />
3. Things some people do, most often.<br />
4. Things some people do, somewhat often.<br />
5. Things few people do, most often.<br />
6. Things few people do, somewhat often.</p>
<p>Then listed exceptions such as start up tasks, features only needed in emergencies, complex systems, and diverse user groups such as roles. I might add some other considerations based on how the application will be used. Is this a quick interaction (what's the time, weather, or special for dinner tonight?) As opposed to a deeper layer of study.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of metaphors so his highway analogy struck a chord with me. This largely boils down to how we choose to drive the highway because it takes us where we want to go quicker. It does this by not providing an exit for every side street, but by skipping most options and spacing out the exits. The value comes from the compromise.</p>
<p>He wrapped up by describing some methods of how to make something discoverable by using real estate, order, form, expectation &amp; flow, and finally consistency. I understood his explanations for these, but I would have liked to have seen some examples which were really well done, or even poor designs which would have benefitted from using these principles.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I read "The A-B-C of Behaviour" because I believe understanding human psychology is an integral part of good design. I love reading about how tiny, inexpensive, seemingly insignificant tweaks can result in big changes.</p>
<p>The writer, Jodie Moule, noted that "What’s fascinating is that while it took a while for the device to find its way to the intended context, once it was there the initiative to change was almost immediate, and the result easy to maintain.  The presence of such a small thing, positioned in the right context, made such a huge impact on my behaviour."<br />
I had two comments about this particular paragraph. My first is a question -- why did it take so long for the device to be used as it should? If a local government agency had been sending these out (at presumably great cost and effort), I think they should've at least provided more instruction to ensure that the egg timers were being used properly.</p>
<p>Secondly, I enjoyed reading about how the egg timer made a big impact on her behavior. This challenges designers to think out of the box and come up with small, inexpensive ways to influence behavior.</p>
<p>Later on in the article, Moule talks about how Melbourne's government attempted to get more people to wear bicycle helmets by introducing laws in the 1990s. However, according to Moule's conclusion, all this appeared to do was decrease the number of cyclists. When trying to influence behavior over a large audience, a lot of people think that the optimal way to do this is to set down laws. But, as Moule argues, this doesn't always work the way people think they will. Setting down a helmet law didn't work in getting people to wear more helmets. Sending egg timers got her to change her behavior -- not a law, increase in water prices, or any such major initiative.</p>
<p>(However, I don't really agree with how she came to the conclusion that the helmet laws resulted in less cyclists. I think there are many other reasons that there are less bicycle injuries after helmet laws were implemented, and not just because of less cyclists. It's possible there are better roads, people are generally better cyclists, people are able to buy better bikes, cycling has become more commonplace hence lesser road rage from motorists, etc. etc. That point aside, I do appreciate the point she's trying to make.)</p>
<p>"So, we can change behaviour through design of products, services and systems, and the best way to do this is to first consider the customers culture and context, before we even start on ideas."</p>
<p>I fully agree with this statement. I think that observing customers is the first step towards great design, although the outcome may not be something we expect!</p>
<p>I also like how she reiterated that change takes time. Obviously, we all want instant results, but behavioral change really does take time! Someone came to our class a few years ago and said that, when designing for behavioral change, to test if our products result in behavioral change in the short term first. For example, if we're designing something that will get people to eat more fruit, we have to test if it makes people eat more fruit just once after using it, and build from there, versus building something with the expectation that it'll be effective long term.</p>
